* First point
What is cancer?
Open up with a definition.  "Imprecise definition . . . " according to Emmanuel
Farber.

* Second point
It is important to note that cancer is not an end stage, but a /step/ in an
/evolutionary history./

** concepts
- progression
- dynamics

* Third point
These dynamics are bound by:
1. genetic and epigenetic context (which are themselves in flux during cancer
   progression)
2. ecological context of the neoplams defined by the cellular and tissue
   integration and response

* Fourth point
Thus, phenotypically, neoplastic cells are defined by:
- proliferation
- dedifferentiation

* Fifth point
Causes of cancer (cancer etiology)

* Sixth point
Dynamics of cancer.  Modifiable program.
