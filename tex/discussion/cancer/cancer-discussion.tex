\section{Cancer}
\label{cancer-discussion}

% This is the \emph{cancer} section of the discussion.

\newthought{Cancer research} aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment through
better disease classification and patient stratification, which allows for the
design of therapies that are more targeted to specific cancer sub-types and
potentially improves the effectiveness of existing regimens based on therapeutic
response and adverse events.

Topics to discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item expectations \emph{vs} reality
\item solid achievements (differentiation sigs)
\item questions raised and issues to address (extent of the prognostic signals)
\item shortcomings of the technology regarding the translation into the clinical realm (nrc-weigelt-2012.pdf)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Where is cancer research now?
\begin{itemize}
\item The importance of genomics to seize the biology of cancer.
\item Vanguard treatments and their experimental motivations.
\item is curing cancer a realistic expectation (as it was in the mid-20th
  century), or will we have to settle for improvement of diagnostic/prognostic
  tools?
\item why are genomics failing in producing a clarification of cancer as
  a biological phenomena?
\item paradox: maximum depth of analytical tools, minimal expectations regarding
  clinical management of disease
\end{itemize}
