\section{Cancer}
\label{cancer-discussion}

% This is the \emph{cancer} section of the discussion.

\newthought{Cancer research} aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment through
better disease classification and patient stratification, which allows for the
design of therapies that are more targeted to specific cancer sub-types and
potentially improves the effectiveness of existing regimens based on therapeutic
response and adverse events.
