\section{Microarrays}
\label{microarray-discussion}

% This is the \emph{microarrays} section of the discussion.

\newthought{Microarray technology}, through the simultaneous assessment of the
expression of thousands of genes, has become the instrument of choice to address
cancer, a disease defined by its complex polygenic
nature.\cite{grant_microarrays_2004} Genomic perturbations drive cancer
progression by disturbing mechanisms for cell cycle control, differentiation,
\smallcaps{dna} repair, apoptosis, tumour vascularization, and metabolism.
