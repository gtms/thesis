\newthought{In October 1995,} a short report in \emph{Science} magazine caught
the eye with a figure showing six grids of colourful stains on a dark background
(Figure~\ref{fig:arabidopsis-microarray}).  The colour of each spot, ranging
through the visible spectrum, captured the fluorescence emitted when a 3.5 mm by
5.5 mm slide of glass was scanned with a laser.  Each slide had been previously
spotted with an array of microscopic droplets of \mbox{forty-five} clones of
c\smallcaps{dna} isolated from \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana}---a small flowering
plant with the smallest genome of any known higher eukaryote.  Before being
scanned, the slides, or microarrays, were hybridized with a solution of
fluorescently labeled, reverse transcribed c\smallcaps{dna}s, synthesized from
m\smallcaps{rna} templates extracted from the plant.

The vivid readouts from the microarrays were literally illuminating the
transcription patterns of the arabidopsis genome.

With this seminal report from Stanford, Mark Schena and Patrick Brown
demonstrated three things.  First, that microarray technology was
\emph{sensitive} and \emph{specific} enough to discriminate between distinct
m\smallcaps{rna} species in solution (Figure~\ref{fig:arabidopsis-microarray},
\textbf{A--B}).  Second, that it could \emph{quantify} discrete levels of
m\smallcaps{rna} transcripts (Figure~\ref{fig:arabidopsis-microarray},
\textbf{C--D}).  Third, that the technology was suited to investigate gene
expression patterns in diverse tissue types
(Figure~\ref{fig:arabidopsis-microarray}, \textbf{E--F}).  As Pat Brown would
state later, microarrays were developed to ``enable a new method for relating
sequence differences in genes to complex traits in people.''  And what bigger
challenge of complexity could there be but cancer?

Four years on, Todd Golub and Eric Lander, at the Broad Institute in Boston,
reported the results of the first tackling on cancer using
microarrays.\cite{golub_molecular_1999} As a test case, they took to Farber's
acute leukemia, isolating m\smallcaps{rna} from 38 biological samples of
neoplastic bone marrow and peripheral blood. Their approach was framed as a
classification task.  Up to then, the problem of classifying cancer subtypes was
mostly left to the expertise of the pathologist,\footnote{Clinical practice for
  cancer classification would involve an experienced pathologist's
  interpretation of the tumour's morphology, histochemistry, immunophenotyping,
  and cytogenetic analysis.} and many cancers still lacked molecular markers for
their accurate definition.  Moreover, the correct distinction between acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (\smallcaps{all}, originating from lymphoid precursors)
and acute myeloid leukemia (\smallcaps{aml}, originating from myeloid
precursors) was critical for the determination of the chemotherapeutic regimen
to be used.

Using a microarray with probes reporting for 6817 human genes, they concluded
that the patterns of expression of a subset of these genes could be used to
accurately discriminate between \smallcaps{aml} and \smallcaps{all}.  They then
sought to use the expression data to blindly \emph{infer} eventual tumour
\mbox{sub-classes} among the samples.  Using a learning algorithm to build a
classifier from the data and then testing it with a cross-validation procedure,
they showed that the \mbox{\smallcaps{aml-all}} distinction could be
automatically discovered and confirmed without a biological \mbox{\emph{a
    priori}}.\footnote{These class prediction and class discovery tasks
  illustrate the distinction between \emph{supervised} and \emph{unsupervised}
  learning.  While the former derives a function from labeled training data
  (thus requiring an \mbox{\emph{a priori}} knowledge of the classes it tries to
  predict), the latter aims to produce a classification without any prior
  knowledge of the structure in the data.}  What's more, this class discovery
approach could be further refined to automatically detect the distinction
between \mbox{\smallcaps{B}-cell} and \mbox{\smallcaps{T}-cell} \smallcaps{all}.
The use of microarrays could thus enable a molecular classification of cancer,
even if this landmark experimental setup could not find a multigene expression
signature to predict response to chemotherapy.

Back in Stanford, the focus was being directed towards breast cancer.  With a
microarray probing for \num{8102} human genes, Charles Perou, Pat Brown and
David Botstein studied the variation in gene expression patterns of breast
tumours from 42 patients.\cite{perou_molecular_2000} Using an unsupervised
hierarchical clustering algorithm, they were able to identify at least five
distinct molecular breast cancer classes.  Two types of epithelial cell are
found in the human mammary gland: basal cells (the outer layer of myoepithelial
cells in the mammary duct) and luminal cells (at the apical surface of the
ducts, with secretory proprieties).  Cancers of luminal origin were found to
cluster in two previously unrecognized groups, termed luminal \smallcaps{a} (of
lower grade) and luminal \smallcaps{b} (of higher grade).  Cancers with a
\mbox{basal-like} phenotype; \mbox{over-expressing} the \smallcaps{her2}
receptor; or with a normal-like phenotype were each found to cluster together in
their respective group.  However, the most robust observed distinction was
between the transcriptome of breast cancers expressing the estrogen receptor
(\smallcaps{ER+}) and those that did not (\smallcaps{ER--}).  This pioneering
study showed that a new taxonomy of breast cancer could be based on its
molecular features---a classification that would be challenged, extended and
refined throughout the ensuing
decade.\cite{sorlie_gene_2001,sorlie_repeated_2003,hu_molecular_2006,pusztai_molecular_2006,rakha_basal-like_2008,parker_supervised_2009,gusterson_basal-like_2009,weigelt_contribution_2010,prat_deconstructing_2011}

While these findings were being reported, Eric Lander was leading another major
collaborative effort that would redefine the breadth of microarray technology.
On February 2001, a \mbox{public-funded} consortium reported the first draft of
the human genome (Figure~\ref{fig:human-genome-cover}).  Prior to this
achievement, the estimated number of genes in our genome was around
\num{100000}.\cite{cox_assessing_1994} As the genome sequence quality and gene
finding methods improved, this figure was progressively revised down to an
estimated \num{20000}--\num{25000} human protein coding genes.  The prospect of
interrogating the \emph{entire} transcriptome of the neoplastic cell with
microarrays was now within reach---and would soon turn into a reality.  If
cancer was fundamentally a genetic disease,\footnote{``The revolution in cancer
  research can be summed up in a single sentence: cancer is, in essence, a
  genetic disease''---\emph{Bert Vogelstein}
  (\citealp{vogelstein_cancer_2004}).} then the study of the cancer genome with
microarrays would bring it into the genomic era.

Mass reporting of cancer transcription profiles.  Which cancers.  Which genes
are deferentially expressed.  First public microarray databases.  Microarray
meta-analysis.  Single cell gene expression profiling.  A compelling case was
made.  Presently.

Wide diversity in tumour profiles and relatively minimal variation in normal
tissue profiles have been found not only for breast cancers, but also for lung,
and gastric cancers.  While nuanced, the global patterns of gene expression of
different cancers where still remarkably consistent within each malady
(Botstein, Fig.4).  Furthermore, tumour samples from the same breast cancer
patient, either by repeated surgical sampling or from lymph node metastases,
tend to have profiles very similar to each other; similar results were reported
in lung and liver tumours.

In the early 1980's, the pathologists of the Nederlands Kanker Instituut
(\smallcaps{nki}) in Amsterdam began a frozen tissue bank of tumours from Dutch
women breast cancers.  Twenty years on, the m\smallcaps{rna} of these samples,
along with the patient's clinical histories, would be the subject of a page
turning gene expression profiling experiment.  A group including
\smallcaps{nki}'s head of molecular pathology, Laura van't Veer, head researcher
René Bernards, and Stephen Friend, a Rosetta Inpharmatics founder in Seattle,
analyzed a selection of primary tumours from 98 women younger than 55 who did
not develop lymph node metastasis.\cite{vant_veer_gene_2002}

When the tumours were originally collected, treatment standards did not require
adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.  Thirty-four patients, or roughly one third
of the women in the study, had since then relapsed their cancer.  According to
modern guidelines, approximately 95\% of the original patients would have
received chemotherapy in the \mbox{United States}, and 85\% would have been
treated under European norms.  This entails that 55\% to 65\% of the patients
would have needlessly undergone an aggressive and debilitating form of
chemotherapy.  To assess whether gene expression profiles could predict
metastatic relapse of disease, the \smallcaps{nki} team profiled the tumours on
a microarray containing approximately \num{25000} genes.  Using a supervised
iterative learning procedure on a subset of these features, they narrowed down a
list of 70 genes whose expression levels correlated with the development of
distant metastasis.  The robustness of this \mbox{70-gene} prognosis profile was
subsequently validated on a wider cohort of 295 breast cancer tumours with
either positive or negative nodal
status.\cite{van_de_vijver_gene-expression_2002} In this study, the classifier
predicted survival and distant metastasis in stratified univariate analyses and
was the strongest predictor of distant metastasis in a multivariate model that
included traditional breast cancer predictors.\footnote{Classical
  prognosticators for breast cancer include age, tumour size, status of axillary
  lymph nodes, histological type of the tumour, pathological grade and
  \mbox{hormone-receptor} status.}  Microarrays were now being used to stratify
cancer risk among patients based on the gene expression profile of the
tumour.\footnote{``Even though you could look under the microscope and they all
  look the same (\ldots{}) some have built into them programs to become
  aggressive''---\emph{Stephen Friend}}

One of the originalities of the \smallcaps{nki} studies was the molecular
dissection of the list of predictor genes derived from their analysis.
