% The first factual evidence of life on Earth appears inscribed in the fossil
% record some 3.5~billion years ago.  It consists mainly of microfossils and
% ancient rock structures in Greenland and Australia called
% stromatolites,\cite{ohtomo_evidence_2014,noffke_microbially_2013} the product
% of the metabolism of photosynthesizing cyanobacteria.

% While the fine details of the abiogenic\footnote{From the Greek ``spontaneous
% generation'', this model posits that autocatalytic polymers able to function
% as simple molecular replicators are at the origin of life.  Alternative models
% exist, most notably panspermia---the extraterrestrial origin of life.} model
% for the origin of life\footnote{Much debate has been stirred around the
% definition of life itself, see for instance \citealp{benner_defining_2010}.}
% remain to be chalked, its primed instances are often depicted as
% \mbox{self-replicating} units able to regulate their own chemical processes
% within the confinement of a cellular membrane.  Such primeval unicellular
% organisms were most likely composed of some form of nucleic acid secluded from
% its external environment by a bilayer of phospholipids.

% Nucleic acids, \smallcaps{rna} and \smallcaps{dna}, are the sole organic
% molecules fit to direct their own replication and to act as genetic material.
% \smallcaps{rna} was proposed as the original genetic system since it was shown
% to be able to catalize a variety of chemical reactions, notably the
% polymerization of nucleotides.\cite{bass_specific_1984} However, as the
% genetic load stored within cells increased, the lesser stability and
% reliability of \smallcaps{rna} molecules rendered them unsuitable for the
% furtherance of genetic systems---a stage at which \smallcaps{dna} eventually
% took over as universal hereditary material.

% These very simple and \mbox{self-organized} systems emerged in seas densely
% enriched in organic molecules and therefore didn't require sophisticated
% toolkits for intake of food or generation of energy.  Only when systematic
% interactions between \smallcaps{rna} and specific amino~acids became enshrined
% in the genetic code\footnote{The central dogma of molecular biology,
% postulated by Francis Crick in 1958 and reasserted in 1970
% (\citealp{crick_protein_1958,crick_central_1970}), pertains to the rules that
% govern the sequential flow of genetic information between \smallcaps{dna},
% \smallcaps{rna} and proteins. It can be summarized as ``\smallcaps{dna} makes
% \smallcaps{rna} makes protein'', which provides the template for the enactment
% of hereditary information for all living organisms and frames the scope of
% evolutionary forces on genetic systems.} did evolution start to shape
% concerted molecular reactions between proteins that animated cells with
% metabolic activity.

% Among the first elaborations of metabolic pathways are likely to have been
% some simpler form of \mbox{modern-day} glycolysis, the anaerobic breakdown of
% glucose to lactic acid.  Glycolysis is a fixture of all \mbox{present-day}
% cells and drives the generation of \smallcaps{atp} molecules, their universal
% source of energy.  This in turn enabled cellular life to fuel ever more
% complex metabolic reactions, such as photosynthesis.

% Photosynthesis is a metabolic reaction that gathers energy from sunlight to
% synthesize organic molecules, at the expense of carbon dioxide and water, and
% generating free oxygen as a \mbox{by-product}.  The emergence of
% \mbox{oxygen-forming} photosynthesis in cellular life, some 2.5~billion years
% ago, had two major impacts in the course of evolution.  Firstly, it liberated
% cells from the need to directly access preformed organic molecules to sustain
% their metabolism; and, secondly, it biologically enriched the content of
% Earth's atmosphere in oxygen,\footnote{This so called ``Great Oxygenation
% Event'', dated to 2.3~billion years ago, was arguably caused by
% photosynthesizing organisms whose presence was tracked long before it occurred
% (\citealp{flannery_archean_2012}). The \smallcaps{goe} likely had a catalytic
% effect in the evolution of life also through the oxidation of exposed rocks,
% liberating phosphorus and iron that flew into the oceans, there acting as
% fertilizer (\citealp{zimmer_mystery_2013}).} which is thought to have been a
% \mbox{pre-condition} for the thriving of eukariotyc life.

% The timetable 3.6-3.7 billion years ago: appearance of life 2.5 billion years
% ago oxygen-forming photosynthesis ~2.2 billion years ago: aerobic respiration
% ~1.5 billion years ago: first evidence of fossil eukaryotes

% Up to that stage, all forms of life on Earth could still be modeled from the
% blueprint of modern Prokaria: a \mbox{single-celled} organism devoid of any
% \mbox{membrane-bound} organelles, capable of lateral \smallcaps{dna} transfer
% and that mainly reproduces itself through binary fission.  The Prokaria taxon
% comprises both Archae (e.g., \mbox{\emph{Thermoplasma}-like} organisms) and
% Eubacteria (e.g., \mbox{\emph{Spirochaeta}-like} organisms), which
% fundamentally differ at the level of the chemical composition of their cell
% walls; the lipidic composition of their plasma membranes; and the number of
% subunits in their \smallcaps{rna} polymerases.

% An hypothetical permanent \mbox{whole-cell} fusion between members of Archaea
% and Eubacteria has been proposed to be at the origin of the earliest anaerobic
% Eukarya,\cite{margulis_archaeal-eubacterial_1996} of which the first fossil
% record evidence could date from a 2.1~billion year black shale formation found
% in Gabon.\cite{albani_large_2010} Eukarya\footnote{From the Greek,
% ``\emph{eu}''---true---and ``\emph{karyon}''---kernel.} are thus defined by
% the presence of specialized organelles enclosed within membranes, namely the
% presence of a discrete nucleus wherein all genetic material is confined.

% The evolution of aerobic respiration, now a possibility in an oxygen rich
% environment, is thought to have occurred about 2.2~billion years ago in
% prokaryotic cells.  The endosymbiotic theory proposes that eukaryotic
% organelles, such like chloroplasts and mitochondria, evolved from certain
% types of bacteria that early eukaryotic cells engulfed through
% endophagocytosis and retained in a mutualistically beneficial relationship.

% The appearance of the integrated eukaryotic cell set the stage for a vast
% collection of evolutionary experiments that propelled a remarkable
% diversification of life forms.  Two critical features were behind this
% radiation: the advent of sexual reproduction and that of multicellular life.

% Sexual reproduction first evolved in a \mbox{single-celled} eukaryotic entity
% some 1.2~billion years ago.\cite{bernstein_dna_2012} The exchange of genetic
% information through recombination during meiosis provided cells with a new
% powerful source of genetic variation, both capable to accelerate adaptation
% rates to new environmental challenges as well as to supply evolution with
% novel genetic backgrounds to operate on.\cite{burt_perspective:_2000}

% resilience of genetic systems

% On the other hand, multicellularity is known to have recurred multiple times
% as an evolutionary experiment throughout different prokaryotic and eukaryotic
% taxa, including animals, fungi, plants and slime
% moulds.\cite{kaiser_building_2001} The first evidence of transition between
% unicellular to multicellular organization is epitomized by fossils of
% prokariotic filamentous and \mbox{mat-forming} \mbox{cyanobacteria-like},
% dating back to 3 to 3.5 billion
% years.\cite{knoll_life_2003,schopf_microfossils_1993} However, cell
% differentiation within these colonies of aggregated cyanobacteria only appears
% more than 2 billion years ago.\cite{tomitani_evolutionary_2006} The first
% multicellular eukaryotes might have emerged some 1 billion years
% ago,\cite{knoll_eukaryotic_2006} while the most significant burst of metazoan
% diversification happened some \mbox{600--700~million} years ago, at a time
% when levels of oxygen in the oceans and in the atmosphere were already rising
% sharply.\cite{carroll_chance_2001,king_unicellular_2004}

% The main implication of multicelullarity is the integration of the cell
% physiology, first at the tissue, then at the organism level---with the
% concomitant progressive loss of individualization and, ultimately,
% independence of the cellular unit.  This integrative process required the
% emergence of a number of essential features, such as cell adhesion,
% \mbox{cell-cell} communication and coordination, and programmed cell death,
% which are likely to have evolved in an unicellular
% context.\cite{bonner_development:_1974,bonner_first_2009,kaiser_building_2001}

% From the evolutionary point of view, the appearance of the molecular
% apparatuses underpinning these innovations is thus relatively recent.
% Consequently, one could expect the genetic networks supporting the essential
% functionalities for multicellular life to lack the degrees of redundancy and
% resiliency of those representing older, more fundamental metabolic pathways
% for the bearing of unicellular life.

% Furthermore, the degrees of cooperation between distinct genetic lineages
% during the transition to multicellularity must also be taken into
% consideration.  Conflicts may arise between lineages devoted to promote the
% cooperative establishment of an efficient multicellular organism and lineages
% focused on selfish proliferation regardless of the integrity and performance
% of the organism.\cite{buss_evolution_1987,hammerstein_genetic_2003}

% The transition to multicellularity is likely to have been driven by the
% advantages associated to increase in size (evasion from predation) and perhaps
% more importantly to the functional specialization and division of labour
% (metabolic cooperation).

% A vivid example of the latter is given by the \emph{volvox}, a genus of
% clorophytes.  These green algae can form colonies of up to \SI{50000} cells
% and can display a degree of differentiation between internal, unflagellated
% germ cells that can divide and give rise to new colonies; and flagellated,
% external somatic cells that keep the colony suspended\cite{kirk_volvox:_2005}
% and promote nutrient exchange.\cite{solari_multicellularity_2006}

% One important distinction between the germinal and somatic lineage in the
% \emph{volvox} is that the somatic cells appear to be terminally differentiated
% and have a limited capacity to proliferate once they form.  This attribute
% illustrates the concept of cell potency, or the cell's ability to
% differentiate into distinct cell types.

% Once the specification between germinal and somatic lineages was achieved, the
% evolution of complexity in multicellular entities then became a function of
% the orderly incorporation on genomes of the rules that guide the precise
% orchestration of cell growth, differentiation and morphogenesis from a
% totipotent spore or zygote into a fully functional and mature organism---a
% process recapitulated in spectacular fashion during the
% embriogenesis\footnote{\smallcaps{todo:} Reference to the biogenic law and
% Gould's ``\emph{Ontogeny and Phylogeny}''.}  of each \mbox{present-day}
% multicellular life form.

% Grosberg & Strathmann also discuss in their review: self/nonself-recognition
% and policing; allorecognition and multicellularity; programmed cell death and
% apoptosis; maternal control in early development; germ-line sequestration

% internalization of cellular specialization into the genetic code leading to:
% transitions to ever more inclusive, hierarchically nested levels of biological
% organization

% embriogenesis

% Concomitantly, the loss of individualization and increasing social integration
% of the cellular tapestry into tissular differentiation lead to the evolution
% of specific cellular pathways

% Multicellular cyanobacteria arose early in the history of life on Earth.

% Multicellular organisms, especially long-living animals, also face the
% challenge of cancer, which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth
% within the normal program of development. Changes in tissue morphology can be
% observed during this process. [from the Wikipedia entry on the evolution of
% multicellularity]

% \medskip

To explain the increase of complexity of evolutionary lineages with time, Eörs
Szathmáry and John Maynard Smith proposed in 1995\cite{szathmary_major_1995} a
series of major evolutionary transitions, each of which unlocked new
evolutionary spaces.  These included: (\emph{a})~the compartmentalization of
replicating molecules, yielding the first cells; (\emph{b})~the coalescing of
replicating molecules to form chromosomes; (\emph{c})~the establishment of
\smallcaps{dna} as the conveyor of heredity and, together with \smallcaps{rna}
and proteins, the agency of the genetic code; (\emph{d})~the consolidation of
symbiotic cells to generate the first eukaryotic cells containing chloroplasts
and mitochondria; (\emph{e})~the emergence of sexual reproduction involving the
production, through meiosis, of haploid gametes and their posterior fusion;
(\emph{f})~the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors;
and (\emph{g})~the establishment of social groups composed of discrete
multicellular individuals.

% A synthesis of the major evolutionary transitions of life discussed so far has
% been proposed by Maynard Smith and Szathmary in the following
% terms:\cite{maynard_smith_major_1997} (\emph{a})~replicating molecules become
% compartmentalized, yielding the first cells; (\emph{b})~replicating molecules
% coalesce to form chromosomes; (\emph{c})~\smallcaps{dna} becomes the conveyor of
% heredity and, together with \smallcaps{rna} and proteins, the agency of the
% genetic code; (\emph{d})~symbiotic cells consolidate to generate the first
% eukaryotic cells containing chloroplasts and mitochondria; (\emph{e})~sexual
% reproduction emerges involving the production, through meiosis, of haploid
% gametes and their posterior fusion; (\emph{f})~multicellular organisms evolve
% from unicellular ancestors; and (\emph{g})~social groups composed of discrete
% multicellular individuals become established.

All throughout theses transitions, major forces were quietly at play knitting
the tapestry of life---prime among which was natural selection.  Trait variation
in populations of conspecific individuals can be generated at the genetic level
by mutational events, and then reshuffled through recombination via sexual
reproduction.  Natural selection then shapes the evolutionary process through
the \mbox{context-dependent} differential heritability of traits across
generations.  This change of inherited characteristics of biological populations
over time can operate at every level of biological organization---from the
individual organism down to the molecular level.

Contemplating the diversity of living forms that surrounds us today, it is hard
not to be overwhelmed by how momentous this account of life is---a feeling best
captured by no other than Darwin himself:\cite{darwin_origin_1864}

% The forces driving this striking set of changes are noteworthy themselves.

% Notes

% A fossil record of highly organized and spatially discrete colonial living
% structures found in a formation of black shales in Gabon dating from 2.1~billion
% years ago could well be the oldest fossil evidence of such
% entities.

\begin{quotation}
  There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been
  originally breathed by the Creator\footnote{This \mbox{oft-cited} final
    passage of \emph{On the Origin of Species} is frequently quoted stripped of
    this reference to a ``creator''.  Such a revisionist stance appears even
    more bizarre in the light of the fact that it was Darwin himself who added
    the reference in editions two through six---arguably to appease both the
    public and his wife (\citealp{thompson_origin_2003}).  A touch of candour
    from the man who ``politely changed the way we see the world forever''
    (\citealp{rutherford_there_2008}).} into a few forms or into one; and that,
  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity,
  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful
  have been, and are being, evolved.
\end{quotation}

How ironic that one of the best models to understand this order of things is
actually one of its most harrowing violations: cancer.
