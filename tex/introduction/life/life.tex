\section{Life}

\newthought{Life is a wonder} of its own.  It conceivably struck this
planet at least some 3.7~billion years ago,\cite{schopf_evidence_2007}
arguably the consequence of a phospholipidic \mbox{layer-bound}
\emph{quantum leap} in a soup of organic
precursors.\cite{miller_organic_1959} From that
singular moment on, little has been spared in guise of
amazement.

The first factual evidence of life on Earth appears inscribed in the
fossil record some 3.5~billion years ago.  It consists mainly of
microfossils and ancient rock structures in Greenland and Australia
called
stromatolites,\cite{ohtomo_evidence_2014,noffke_microbially_2013} the
product of the metabolism of photosynthesizing cyanobacteria.

\begin{quotation}
  There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been
  originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet
  has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a
  beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are
  being, evolved.
\end{quotation}

How ironic that one of the best models to understand this order of things is
actually one of its most harrowing violations: cancer.
