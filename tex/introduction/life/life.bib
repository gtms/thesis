	abstract = {Fossil evidence of the existence of life during the Archean Eon of Earth history (\&gt;2500 Ma) is summarized. Data are outlined for 48 Archean deposits reported to contain biogenic stromatolites and for 14 such units that contain a total of 40 morphotypes of described microfossils. Among the oldest of these putatively microfossiliferous units is a brecciated chert of the ∼3465 Ma Apex Basalt of Western Australia. The paleoenvironment, carbonaceous composition, mode of preservation, and morphology of the Apex microbe-like filaments, backed by new evidence of their cellular structure provided by two- and three-dimensional Raman imagery, support their biogenic interpretation. Such data, together with the presence of stromatolites, microfossils, and carbon isotopic evidence of biological activity in similarly aged deposits, indicate that the antiquity of life on Earth extends to at least ∼3500 Ma.},

	abstract = {Some graphite contained in the 3.7-billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks of the Isua Supracrustal Belt, Western Greenland, is depleted in {13C} and has been interpreted as evidence for early life. However, it is unclear whether this graphite is primary, or was precipitated from metamorphic or igneous fluids. Here we analyse the geochemistry and structure of the {13C-} depleted graphite in the Isua schists. Raman spectroscopy and geochemical analyses indicate that the schists are formed from clastic marine sediments that contained {13C-depleted} carbon at the time of their deposition. Transmission electron microscope observations show that graphite in the schist occurs as nanoscale polygonal and tube-like grains, in contrast to abiotic graphite in carbonate veins that exhibits a flaky morphology. Furthermore, the graphite grains in the schist contain distorted crystal structures and disordered stacking of sheets of graphene. The observed morphologies are consistent with pyrolysation and pressurization of structurally heterogeneous organic compounds during metamorphism. We thus conclude that the graphite contained in the Isua metasediments represents traces of early life that flourished in the oceans at least 3.7 billion years ago.},

	abstract = {Microbially induced sedimentary structures ({MISS)} result from the response of microbial mats to physical sediment dynamics. {MISS} are cosmopolitan and found in many modern environments, including shelves, tidal flats, lagoons, riverine shores, lakes, interdune areas, and sabkhas. The structures record highly diverse communities of microbial mats and have been reported from numerous intervals in the geological record up to 3.2 billion years (Ga) old. This contribution describes a suite of {MISS} from some of the oldest well-preserved sedimentary rocks in the geological record, the early Archean (ca. 3.48 Ga) Dresser Formation, Western Australia. Outcrop mapping at the meter to millimeter scale defined five sub-environments characteristic of an ancient coastal sabkha. These sub-environments contain associations of distinct macroscopic and microscopic {MISS.} Macroscopic {MISS} include polygonal oscillation cracks and gas domes, erosional remnants and pockets, and mat chips. Microscopic {MISS} comprise tufts, sinoidal structures, and laminae fabrics; the microscopic laminae are composed of primary carbonaceous matter, pyrite, and hematite, plus trapped and bound grains. Identical suites of {MISS} occur in equivalent environmental settings through the entire subsequent history of Earth including the present time. This work extends the geological record of {MISS} by almost 300 million years. Complex mat-forming microbial communities likely existed almost 3.5 billion years ago.

Accordingly, this article discusses various definitions of life held in the astrobiology community by considering their connected “theories of life.” These include certain “list” definitions and a popular definition that holds that life is a “self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.” We then act as “anthropologists,” studying what scientists do to determine which definition-theories of life they constructively hold as they design missions to seek non-terran life. We also look at how constructive beliefs about biosignatures change as observational data accumulate. And we consider how a definition centered on Darwinian evolution might itself be forced to change as supra-Darwinian species emerge, including in our descendents, and consider the chances of our encountering supra-Darwinian species in our exploration of the Cosmos. Last, we ask what chemical structures might support Darwinian evolution universally; these structures might be universal biosignatures.

A modest diversity of problematic, possibly stem group protists occurs in ca 1800–1300 Myr old rocks. 1300–720 Myr fossils document the divergence of major eukaryotic clades, but only with the {Ediacaran–Cambrian} radiation of animals did diversity increase within most clades with fossilizable members. While taxonomic placement of many Proterozoic eukaryotes may be arguable, the presence of characters used for that placement is not.

Except for the nearly 2-Gyr–old coil-shaped fossil Grypania spiralis, which may have been eukaryotic, evidence for morphological and taxonomic biodiversification of macroorganisms only occurs towards the beginning of the Mesoproterozoic era (1.6–1.0 Gyr). Here we report the discovery of centimetre-sized structures from the 2.1-Gyr-old black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian B Formation in Gabon, which we interpret as highly organized and spatially discrete populations of colonial organisms. The structures are up to 12 cm in size and have characteristic shapes, with a simple but distinct ground pattern of flexible sheets and, usually, a permeating radial fabric. Geochemical analyses suggest that the sediments were deposited under an oxygenated water column. Carbon and sulphur isotopic data indicate that the structures were distinct biogenic objects, fossilized by pyritization early in the formation of the rock. The growth patterns deduced from the fossil morphologies suggest that the organisms showed cell-to-cell signalling and coordinated responses, as is commonly associated with multicellular organization. The Gabon fossils, occurring after the 2.45–2.32-Gyr increase in atmospheric oxygen concentration, may be seen as ancient representatives of multicellular life, which expanded so rapidly 1.5 Gyr later, in the Cambrian explosion.},
