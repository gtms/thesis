\section{The extent of prognostic signals in the cancer transcriptomes}
\label{sec:results-prognostic-survival}

The vast majority of mechanistic cancer studies are performed in animals and/or
\emph{in vitro} models for ethical reasons.  Proving that a biological mechanism
established in these experimental systems contributes to cancer progression in
human requires clinical trials, which are costly and take years to perform.
Therefore, researchers have relied on weaker correlative evidence to back the
relevance of their findings to human diseases.  One such evidence is the
statistically significant association of a molecular maker of the biological
mechanism under investigation with disease outcome in human.  Such association
can be established with non-interventional clinical studies and has been
extensively used in the past decades.  Moreover, this approach has recently
gained popularity with the availability of web
servers\cite{gyorffy_online_2010,ringner_gobo:_2011,gyorffy_online_2013} that
provide, for free, association statistics between any single- or multi-gene
markers and cancer outcomes using publicly available cancer transcriptome
databases.

To retain a biological bearing, the reported association must however be
specific of the biomarker under analysis and not reflect a global property of
the transcriptome.  Most studies estimate the association with a log-rank test
based on a Cox Proportional Hazards model and use a Kaplan-Meier curve to
visualize it.  None of these tools control for the possibility that a large
fraction of transcriptome could be associated with outcome and that, therefore,
the prognostic signal is non-specific.

Disturbingly, this possibility has been proven true in
bladder\cite{lauss_prediction_2010} and
breast\cite{ein-dor_outcome_2005,mosley_cell_2008,venet_most_2011} cancers.  In
particular, our group has shown\cite{venet_most_2011} that more than half of the
transcriptome is correlated with proliferation in two breast cancer cohorts and
that one out of four single genes and that nine out of ten random signatures
comprised of more than 100 genes were associated with overall survival at
$p<0.05$.  As a consequence, most published signatures were found to be
significantly prognostic, but no more prognostic than random sets of genes.

To investigate whether the pervasive association of the transcriptome with
outcome extends to other cohorts and other types of cancers we compiled 114
published gene-expression datasets with patient follow-up from the
\smallcaps{geo}\cite{edgar_gene_2002}, InSilicoDB\cite{coletta_insilico_2012}
and the \smallcaps{tcga} Research Network
databases.\footnote{\href{http://cancergenome.nih.gov/}{http://cancergenome.nih.gov/}}
These included human cancers from 19 organ systems, and a representative range
of microarray platforms (Table~\ref{tab:datasets}).

  \caption[Prognostic content in human cancers]{Prognostic content in human
    cancers.  The fraction of markers significantly associated with outcome at
    logrank $p<0.05$ is shown for single-gene markers, multi-gene markers from
    the \mbox{MSigDB \smallcaps{c2}} database, and randomly generated
    multi-genes markers devoid of biological meaning.  The latter was used to
    order the datasets. Fractions were computed from death-related end-points
    when available (\smallcaps{os} or \smallcaps{dss}), or relapse otherwise
    (\smallcaps{dfs} or \smallcaps{dmfs}). The dotted red line marks the 0.05
    threshold.}
  \label{fig:prognostic-fraction}%
\end{figure}

For each dataset, we computed the fraction of genes associated with outcome at
log-rank $p<0.05$ (Figure~\ref{fig:prognostic-fraction}).  This quantity may be
viewed as the probability of observing a significantly prognostic single gene
marker by chance alone.  We thus refer to these estimates as the baseline
prognostic content\footnote{Prognostic content will henceforth refer to the
  fraction of tested markers found associated with outcome in a given dataset.}
of cancer transcriptomes.  Overall, the median prognostic content across all
studies for single-gene markers was 12\%.  In 100 of the 114 datasets
analyzed (88\%), more than five percent of single-gene markers showed a
significant association with outcome.  % It was higher than 5\% and random %
% multi-gene markers was, respectively, 12\% and 16\%.                     %
% The median fraction was 9%. It was higher than 5% for 95 (83%) datasets.
To take an extreme example, an investigator measuring the association of a gene
with outcome in the \smallcaps{kirc} datasets (kidney cancer) has a 50\% chance
to obtain a positive result---a value far above the canonical 5\% significance
threshold.

To investigate recent multi-gene approaches, we ran a similar calculation for
each of the 4722 curated gene sets of the \mbox{MSigDB \smallcaps{c2}}
database\cite{liberzon_molecular_2011} (Figure~\ref{fig:prognostic-fraction}).
% The prognostic fraction was larger for signatures than for single genes, with
% a median of 12%.
The prognostic content was larger for multi-gene markers than for single-gene
markers, with a median of 19\%.  The prognostic content for multi-gene markers
was larger than 5\% in 76\% of the datasets (87 out of 114), larger than 20\% in
48\% (55/114), and larger than 50\% in 19\% (22/114) of the datasets.  To
control for possible biases of \mbox{MSigDB \smallcaps{c2}} towards
oncology-related signatures, we reran the same computation, but replacing each
signature by a similarly sized set of randomly selected genes.  The overall
qualitative result is unchanged (Figure~\ref{fig:prognostic-fraction}).

Intriguingly, single-gene prognostic content was found to be largely
heterogeneous across datasets related to the same organ system.  For example, it
ranged from 4\% to 59\% among the 33 breast cancer datasets analyzed.  To
investigate the contributions of potential biological and demographic
dataset-specific factors to this effect, we quantified single-marker prognostic
fraction for re-samplings of the \num{1972} transcriptomes of the
\smallcaps{metabric} breast cancer cohort, regarding modulations of four
variables: sample size, duration of follow-up time, fraction of \smallcaps{er}+
patients, and fraction of node positive patients
(Figure~\ref{fig:bootstrap-metabric}).  We chose \smallcaps{metabric} for this
analysis because it is one of the largest cohorts of cancer patients with
follow-up and extensive clinical annotation data available in the public domain.

\begin{figure*}

    expression profiles, out of the total 1972 \smallcaps{metabric} profiles.

    of \smallcaps{er}+ samples.  \textbf{E--}Effect of the fraction of node
    positive patients.  \num{100} samplings, each of 500 patients, were assessed
    with the respective fraction of node positive patients.}
  \label{fig:bootstrap-metabric}
\end{figure*}

The estimates of prognostic content were found to be markedly sensitive to
sampling variance, as suggested by the dispersal of the distribution of
estimates (confidence interval: 12\% to 23\%), when \num{100} samplings of
\num{500} random transcriptomes were examined for the fraction of genes
associated with outcome (Figure~\ref{fig:bootstrap-metabric}\emph{a}).  This
feature alone is likely to yield a significant contribution to the range of
estimates computed in our meta-analysis, as 108 of the 114 datasets analyzed
included less than \num{500} profiled tumours.  Moreover, the sensitivity of our
estimation procedure is, unsurprisingly, largely dependent on the number of
profiles included in the analysis, as shown by a bootstrapping experiment of
sample sizes towards the assessment of the prognostic fraction
(Figure~\ref{fig:bootstrap-metabric}\emph{b}).  Provocatively, the estimates of
prognostic content do not appear to level off even when the experimental sample
size reached \num{1750}---by far the largest in the field.  A sampling
experiment of sequential truncation of follow-up times was equally shown to
impact estimates of prognostic content
(Figure~\ref{fig:bootstrap-metabric}\emph{c}).  Sharply increasing predictive
fractions were observed up to the fifth year of follow-up, followed by a gradual
decrease of the estimates for higher follow-up times.  This trend suggests that,
in breast cancers, prognostic patterns of expression are optimally correlated
with short-term forms of progression of the disease, and that long-term forms of
progression are less efficiently predicted from primary tumour transcriptomes.
The modulation of the fraction of \smallcaps{er}+ transcriptomes towards
experimental samplings of our estimate has exposed a tendency congruent with the
clinical relevance of this receptor in breast cancer pathology
(Figure~\ref{fig:bootstrap-metabric}\emph{d}).  Thus, an increase of
\smallcaps{er}+ profiles to up to 50\% in our samplings leads to a corresponding
linear rise in estimates of prognostic content, at which point a further
increase in the proportion of \smallcaps{er}+ profiles yields little impact on
fraction estimates.  This observation is in line with the fact that the
predictive power of most signatures in breast cancer is mostly confined to
\smallcaps{er}+ phenotypes.\cite{weigelt_challenges_2012} A last sampling
experiment with increasing fractions of profiles from node positive patients
(Figure~\ref{fig:bootstrap-metabric}\emph{e}) also revealed an increasing
pattern of prognostic fraction estimates.  This trend could be explained by the
fact that nodal status is clinically correlated to \smallcaps{er} status in
breast cancer.

% First, repeated random selection of profiles reveals that sampling effects are   %
% substantial (prognostic fraction CI=6-17%) with 500 patients                     %
% (Fig. 2A), a size in par with the largest studies. Second, the prognostic        %
% fraction, as expected, depends on sample size (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, it shows %
% no sign of inflection as N reaches 1750, by far the largest sample size in the   %
% field. Third, we investigated the impact of follow-up time by artificially       %
% truncating follow-up data (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Methods). Shorter and longer   %
% maximum follow-up times yielded lower prognostic fractions, consistent with the  %
% fact that incomplete data, but also late events12, are not predictable from      %
% primary tumor transcriptomes. Fourth, increasing the fraction of ER+ patients up %
% to 50% increases the prognostic fraction, but has no effect beyond               %
% 50% (Fig. 2D). This is compatible with the notion that                           %
% transcriptional marker are more prognostic within the ER+ group and that the ER+ %
% patients have, on average, a better prognostic than ER- patients.13 Fifth,       %
% increasing the fraction of node positive patients, which is correlated with ER   %
% status, also increases the prognostic fraction (Fig. 2E). Sixth, lower           %
% cellularity is unexpectedly associated with a higher prognostic fraction         %
% (Fig. 2F). This may reflect the role of the microenvironment in breast cancer    %
% progression and the massive impact of cell types proportions on the              %
% transcriptomes of bulk tissues.14                                                %

Finally, dataset-specific processing details may also distort prognostic
estimates.  Consider, for instance, dataset \smallcaps{gse9893}, which exhibits
the highest prognostic fractions measured in our study
(Figure~\ref{fig:prognostic-fraction}).  A thorough reanalysis of this dataset,
detailed in a vignette following this text, reveals that its normalization was
performed in two batches and induced massive spurious correlations between
global values of expression and survival outcome.  Accordingly, a proper
single-batch normalization of the raw expression data restores a signal-to-noise
metrics to comparable values with other datasets, and decreases measurements of
prognostic content from 59\% to 19\% for \smallcaps{gse9893}.

We have shown that the fraction of prognostic single- and multi-gene biomarkers
is greater that 5\% in the majority of publicly available transcriptome
datasets.  Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the probability of a
significant single- or multi-gene marker association with outcome depends on
cohorts’ demographics, but also to a large extent on technical factors that
include sampling effects, cohort size, patient follow-up protocols, protocol
randomization and possibly other factors not addressed here.  These findings
call for the reappraisal of conclusions made by previous studies pertaining to
the implication of biological mechanisms to human cancer based on associations
of biomarkers with outcome---including low-throughput \smallcaps{pcr}-based
studies.  They also call for study-specific controls akin to those presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:prognostic-fraction} in future studies.

However, a biomarker does not need to convey relevant biological information
regarding the course of disease in order to be useful in the clinic.  Therefore,
our results have no bearing on the clinical utility of published biomarker
associations.

% \subsection{Datasets}
% \label{sec:results-prognostic-survival-datasets}

% A total of 114 public datasets of cancer gene expression profiles spanning 19
% types of cancer were downloaded from public repositories, manually curated and
% pre-processed for downstream analysis.  Sources for datasets include the Gene
% Expression Omnibus,\cite{edgar_gene_2002}
% InSilicoDB,\cite{taminau_insilicodb:_2011} and the \smallcaps{tcga} Research
% Network
% site.\footnote{\href{http://cancergenome.nih.gov/}{http://cancergenome.nih.gov/}}
% Individual datasets are described in the

% \subsection{Gene sets}
% \label{sec:results-prognostic-survival-genesets}

% For each cancer dataset, we evaluated the association with clinical outcome of
% the 4722 curated gene sets from the
% \href{http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp}Molecular Signatures
% Database (\mbox{MSigDB
% \smallcaps{c2}}).\footnote{\href{http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp}{http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp}}
% \mbox{MSigDB \smallcaps{c2}} signatures are manually curated from the literature
% on gene expression and also include gene sets from curated pathways databases
% such as \smallcaps{kegg}.

% Version 4.0 of the MSigDB curated gene sets (updated on May 31, 2013) was
% downloaded and parsed to produce two lists of gene expression signatures: one
% containing the 4722 original signatures with gene symbols as identifiers, and a
% randomized list consisting of 4722 signatures of the same size as the originals,
% but composed of random samplings from the total pool of genes in the collection.

% \subsection{Association with outcome}
% \label{sec:results-prognostic-survival-association}

% Association with outcome was computed as follows.  For each cancer dataset, we
% retained the first of the following clinical outcomes available, in decreasing
% order of importance: disease-specific survival (\smallcaps{dss}); overall
% survival (\smallcaps{os}); disease-free survival (\smallcaps{dfs}); and distant
% metastasis free survival (\smallcaps{dmfs}).  The survival times for the
% selected clinical outcome specified the dependent variables.

% We then modeled the association of each gene set with survival times by fitting
% a univariate Cox proportional hazards model, using the continuous first
% principal component loading vector of the signature in the global expression
% matrix as the predictor variable.  The \emph{p}-value of the associated logrank
% test was used to estimate association of the gene set with survival times.

% A similar procedure was followed to compute the association of each single gene
% in the expression matrix with survival times, by using the respective continuous
% vector of expression as the predictor variable in the Cox model.  Here again, the
% \emph{p}-value of the logrank test was used to estimate association with
% outcome.

% \subsection{Prognostic content in human cancers}
% \label{sec:results-prognostic-survival-prognostic-content}

% Figure~\ref{fig:prognostic-fraction} shows, for each human cancer dataset
% analyzed, the fraction of \mbox{MSigDB \smallcaps{c2}} signatures, randomized
% signatures and single genes found significantly associated with outcome, at
% $p < 0.05$.

% but composed of random samplings from the total pool of genes in the collection.

% \subsection{Association with outcome}
% \label{sec:results-prognostic-survival-association}

% Association with outcome was computed as follows.  For each cancer dataset, we
% retained the first of the following clinical outcomes available, in decreasing
% order of importance: disease-specific survival (\smallcaps{dss}); overall
% survival (\smallcaps{os}); disease-free survival (\smallcaps{dfs}); and distant
% metastasis free survival (\smallcaps{dmfs}).  The survival times for the
% selected clinical outcome specified the dependent variables.

% We then modeled the association of each gene set with survival times by fitting
% a univariate Cox proportional hazards model, using the continuous first
% principal component loading vector of the signature in the global expression
% matrix as the predictor variable.  The \emph{p}-value of the associated logrank
% test was used to estimate association of the gene set with survival times.

% A similar procedure was followed to compute the association of each single gene
% in the expression matrix with survival times, by using the respective continuous
% vector of expression as the predictor variable in the Cox model.  Here again, the
% \emph{p}-value of the logrank test was used to estimate association with
% outcome.

% \subsection{Prognostic content in human cancers}
% \label{sec:results-prognostic-survival-prognostic-content}

% Figure~\ref{fig:prognostic-fraction} shows, for each human cancer dataset
% analyzed, the fraction of \mbox{MSigDB \smallcaps{c2}} signatures, randomized
% signatures and single genes found significantly associated with outcome, at
% $p < 0.05$.

%   the \mbox{MSigDB \smallcaps{c2}} database, and randomly generated
%   multi-genes markers devoid of biological meaning.  The latter was used to
%   order the datasets. Fractions were computed from death-related end-points
%   when available (\smallcaps{os} or \smallcaps{dss}), or relapse otherwise
%   (\smallcaps{dfs} or \smallcaps{dmfs}). The dotted red line marks the 0.05
%   threshold.}

% \subsection{Distribution of survival times}

% \end{marginfigure}

% For each of the 13 breast cancer datasets with overall survival (\smallcaps{os})
% data in our analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:distribution-survival-times}), we computed
% the fraction of genes associated with \smallcaps{os} at logrank $p < 0.05$ for
% \num{100} permutations of the respective survival times constructs
% (Figure~\ref{fig:null-breast-os}).

% \subsection{Re-sampling of \smallcaps{metabric} dataset}
% \label{sec:results-prognostic-survival-metabric}

% The discovery and validation \smallcaps{metabric} datasets comprise altogether
% \num{1972} expression profiles of breast cancers.\cite{curtis_genomic_2012} This
% constitutes one of the largest cohorts of cancer patients with follow-up and
% extensive clinical annotation data available in the public domain.

% We ran a series of bootstrapping experiments in a merged \smallcaps{metabric}
% dataset aiming at assessing the effect of potential confounding factors in the
% quantification of the prognostic signals of cancer transcriptomes.
% Figure~\ref{fig:bootstrap-metabric} shows distributions of single-marker
% prognostic fractions for the following experimental setups: (\emph{a})~\num{100}
% samplings of size \num{500} each, out of the total \mbox{1972}
% \smallcaps{metabric} transcriptomes; (\emph{b})~\num{100} samplings of size $N$,
% for every $N \in \{100, 200, 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750\}$;
% (\emph{c})~\num{100} samplings of size \num{500}, with survival times
% beyond time $t$ months artificially censored at time $t$, for every
% $t \in \{25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, \max(\text{follow-up time})\}$;
% (\emph{d})~\num{100} samplings, each comprised of $300 \times E$ \smallcaps{er}+
% samples and $300 \times (1-E)$ \smallcaps{er}-- samples, for every
% $E \in \{0, 0.1, 0.2, \ldots{}, 0.9, 1\}$; and (\emph{e})~\num{100} samplings,
% each comprised of $500 \times L$ lymph node positive samples and
% $500 \times (1-L)$ lymph node negative samples, for every
% $L \in \{0, 0.1, 0.2, \ldots{}, 0.9, 1\}$.

\subsection{Role of Epac and protein kinase A in thyrotropin-induced gene
  expression in primary thyrocytes}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics{../pdf/include/epac-cover.pdf}
\end{figure}

This work sought to clarify which partners of the c\smallcaps{amp} cascade
regulate the \smallcaps{tsh}-induced gene expression modulation in thyrocytes:
protein kinase \smallcaps{a} and/or the \smallcaps{epac} proteins.  Contingent
to this objective was the characterization of the potential role of the
Epac-Rap-RapGAP pathway in thyroid tumorigenesis.  The author contributed with
data analysis, figure generation and results discussion.

  thyroid cancer cell lines, but modulates genes that are involved in adaptation
  \emph{in vitro}}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics{../pdf/include/5-aza-cover.pdf}
\end{figure}

This work aimed at investigating the extent to which 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a
\smallcaps{dna} demethylation agent, is able to reactivate the expression of
differentiation markers potentially repressed by epigenetic
modifications in thyroid cancer cell lines.  The author contributed with data
analysis, figure generation and results discussion.
