The contributions of this thesis are based on the analysis of global gene
expression profiles of cancer biopsies with microarray technology.  This chapter
begins by introducing the technology itself.  It then presents the flow of
microarray data analysis, including the preprocessing of raw data.  Next, it
lists and details the analytic methods used to make inferences about gene
expression data. Finally, it describes the public microarray datasets used in
the analyses reported in the \hyperref[chap:results]{\textsf{Results}} section.

% Pre-processing of raw-data includes reporting of internal quality controls, the
% normalization of probe intensities and their summarization.
