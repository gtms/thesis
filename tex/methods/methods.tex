The contributions of this thesis are based on the analysis of global gene
expression profiles of cancer biopsies with microarray technology.  This section
begins by introducing the technology itself.  It then proceeds by detailing the
flow of microarray data analysis, including the pre-prossessing of raw data.
Next, it lists and details the analyses methods used to make inferences about
gene expression data. Finally, it describes the datasets used in the analyses
reported in the \hyperref[chap:results]{\textsf{Results}} section.

% Pre-processing of raw-data includes reporting of internal quality controls, the
% normalization of probe intensities and their summarization.
