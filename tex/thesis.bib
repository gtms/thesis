	abstract = {Fossil evidence of the existence of life during the Archean Eon of Earth history (\&gt;2500 Ma) is summarized. Data are outlined for 48 Archean deposits reported to contain biogenic stromatolites and for 14 such units that contain a total of 40 morphotypes of described microfossils. Among the oldest of these putatively microfossiliferous units is a brecciated chert of the ∼3465 Ma Apex Basalt of Western Australia. The paleoenvironment, carbonaceous composition, mode of preservation, and morphology of the Apex microbe-like filaments, backed by new evidence of their cellular structure provided by two- and three-dimensional Raman imagery, support their biogenic interpretation. Such data, together with the presence of stromatolites, microfossils, and carbon isotopic evidence of biological activity in similarly aged deposits, indicate that the antiquity of life on Earth extends to at least ∼3500 Ma.},

	abstract = {Some graphite contained in the 3.7-billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks of the Isua Supracrustal Belt, Western Greenland, is depleted in 13C and has been interpreted as evidence for early life. However, it is unclear whether this graphite is primary, or was precipitated from metamorphic or igneous fluids. Here we analyse the geochemistry and structure of the 13C- depleted graphite in the Isua schists. Raman spectroscopy and geochemical analyses indicate that the schists are formed from clastic marine sediments that contained 13C-depleted carbon at the time of their deposition. Transmission electron microscope observations show that graphite in the schist occurs as nanoscale polygonal and tube-like grains, in contrast to abiotic graphite in carbonate veins that exhibits a flaky morphology. Furthermore, the graphite grains in the schist contain distorted crystal structures and disordered stacking of sheets of graphene. The observed morphologies are consistent with pyrolysation and pressurization of structurally heterogeneous organic compounds during metamorphism. We thus conclude that the graphite contained in the Isua metasediments represents traces of early life that flourished in the oceans at least 3.7 billion years ago.},

The structures record highly diverse communities of microbial mats and have been reported from numerous intervals in the geological record up to 3.2 billion years (Ga) old. This contribution describes a suite of {MISS} from some of the oldest well-preserved sedimentary rocks in the geological record, the early Archean (ca. 3.48 Ga) Dresser Formation, Western Australia. Outcrop mapping at the meter to millimeter scale defined five sub-environments characteristic of an ancient coastal sabkha. These sub-environments contain associations of distinct macroscopic and microscopic {MISS}. Macroscopic {MISS} include polygonal oscillation cracks and gas domes, erosional remnants and pockets, and mat chips. Microscopic {MISS} comprise tufts, sinoidal structures, and laminae fabrics; the microscopic laminae are composed of primary carbonaceous matter, pyrite, and hematite, plus trapped and bound grains. Identical suites of {MISS} occur in equivalent environmental settings through the entire subsequent history of Earth including the present time. This work extends the geological record of {MISS} by almost 300 million years. Complex mat-forming microbial communities likely existed almost 3.5 billion years ago.

We also look at how constructive beliefs about biosignatures change as observational data accumulate. And we consider how a definition centered on Darwinian evolution might itself be forced to change as supra-Darwinian species emerge, including in our descendents, and consider the chances of our encountering supra-Darwinian species in our exploration of the Cosmos. Last, we ask what chemical structures might support Darwinian evolution universally; these structures might be universal biosignatures. Key Words: Evolution—Life—Life detection—Biosignatures.

A modest diversity of problematic, possibly stem group protists occurs in ca 1800–1300 Myr old rocks. 1300–720 Myr fossils document the divergence of major eukaryotic clades, but only with the Ediacaran–Cambrian radiation of animals did diversity increase within most clades with fossilizable members. While taxonomic placement of many Proterozoic eukaryotes may be arguable, the presence of characters used for that placement is not.

Except for the nearly 2-Gyr–old coil-shaped fossil Grypania spiralis, which may have been eukaryotic, evidence for morphological and taxonomic biodiversification of macroorganisms only occurs towards the beginning of the Mesoproterozoic era (1.6–1.0 Gyr). Here we report the discovery of centimetre-sized structures from the 2.1-Gyr-old black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian B Formation in Gabon, which we interpret as highly organized and spatially discrete populations of colonial organisms. The structures are up to 12 cm in size and have characteristic shapes, with a simple but distinct ground pattern of flexible sheets and, usually, a permeating radial fabric. Geochemical analyses suggest that the sediments were deposited under an oxygenated water column. Carbon and sulphur isotopic data indicate that the structures were distinct biogenic objects, fossilized by pyritization early in the formation of the rock. The growth patterns deduced from the fossil morphologies suggest that the organisms showed cell-to-cell signalling and coordinated responses, as is commonly associated with multicellular organization. The Gabon fossils, occurring after the 2.45–2.32-Gyr increase in atmospheric oxygen concentration, may be seen as ancient representatives of multicellular life, which expanded so rapidly 1.5 Gyr later, in the Cambrian explosion.},

	abstract = {The rock record provides us with unique evidence for testing models as to when and where cellular life first appeared on Earth. Its study, however, requires caution. The biogenicity of stromatolites and ‘microfossils’ older than 3.0 Gyr should not be accepted without critical analysis of morphospace and context, using multiple modern techniques, plus rejection of alternative non-biological (null) hypotheses. The previous view that the co-occurrence of biology-like morphology and carbonaceous chemistry in ancient, microfossil-like objects is a presumptive indicator of biogenicity is not enough. As with the famous Martian microfossils, we need to ask not ‘what do these structures remind us of?’, but ‘what are these structures?’ Earth's oldest putative ‘microfossil’ assemblages within 3.4–3.5 Gyr carbonaceous cherts, such as the Apex Chert, are likewise self-organizing structures that do not pass tests for biogenicity.
There is a preservational paradox in the fossil record prior to ca 2.7 Gyr: suitable rocks (e.g. isotopically light carbonaceous cherts) are widely present, but signals of life are enigmatic and hard to decipher. One new approach includes detailed mapping of well-preserved sandstone grains in the ca 3.4 Gyr Strelley Pool Chert. These can contain endolithic microtubes showing syngenicity, grain selectivity and several levels of geochemical processing. Preliminary studies invite comparison with a class of ambient inclusion trails of putative microbial origin and with the activities of modern anaerobic proteobacteria and volcanic glass euendoliths.},

transfer of {DNA} from one bacterium to another, followed by 
recombination between the resident {DNA} and the incoming {DNA}. In 
eukaryotes, the sexual cycle involves recombination between paired {DNA}

	title = {Perspective: sex, recombination, and the efficacy of selection--was Weismann right?},
	volume = {54},
	issn = {0014-3820},
	shorttitle = {Perspective},
	abstract = {The idea that sex functions to provide variation for natural selection to act upon was first advocated by August Weismann and it has dominated much discussion on the evolution of sex and recombination since then. The goal of this paper is to further extend this hypothesis and to assess its place in a larger body of theory on the evolution of sex and recombination. A simple generic model is developed to show how fitness variation and covariation interact with selection for recombination and illustrate some important implications of the hypothesis: (1) the advantage of sex and recombination can accrue both to reproductively isolated populations and to modifiers segregating within populations, but the former will be much larger than the latter; (2) forces of degradation that are correlated across loci within an individual can reduce or reverse selection for increased recombination; and (3) crossing-over (which can occur at different places in different meioses) will create more variability than having multiple chromosomes and so will have more influence on the efficacy of selection. Several long-term selection experiments support Weismann's hypothesis, including those showing a greater response to selection in populations with higher rates of recombination and higher rates of recombination evolving as a correlated response to selection for some other character. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with the sporadic distribution of obligate asexuality, which indicates that clones have a higher rate of extinction than sexuals. Weismann's hypothesis is then discussed in light of other patterns in the distribution of sexuality versus asexuality. To account for variation in the frequency of obligate asexuality in different taxa, a simple model is developed in which this frequency is a function of three parameters: the rate of clonal origin, the initial fitness of clones when they arise, and the rate at which that fitness declines over time. Variation in all three parameters is likely to be important in explaining the distribution of obligate asexuality. Facultative asexuality also exists, and for this to be stable it seems there must be ecological differences between the sexual and asexual propagules as well as genetic differences. Finally, the timing of sex in cyclical parthenogens is most likely set to minimize the opportunity costs of sex. None of these patterns contradict Weismann's hypothesis, but they do show that many additional principles unrelated to the function of sex are required to fully explain its distribution. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with what we know about the mechanics and molecular genetics of recombination, in particular the tendency for chromatids to recombine with a homolog rather than a sister chromatid at meiosis, which is opposite to what they do during mitosis. However, molecular genetic studies have shown that cis-acting sites at which recombination is initiated are lost by gene conversion as a result, a factor that can be expected to affect many fine details in the evolution of recombination. In summary, although Weismann's hypothesis must be considered the leading candidate for the function of sex and recombination, nevertheless, many additional principles are needed to fully account for their evolution.},

	abstract = {Benefits of increased size and functional specialization of cells have repeatedly promoted the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors. Many requirements for multicellular organization (cell adhesion, cell-cell communication and coordination, programmed cell death) likely evolved in ancestral unicellular organisms. However, the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors may be opposed by genetic conflicts that arise when mutant cell lineages promote their own increase at the expense of the integrity of the multicellular organism. Numerous defenses limit such genetic conflicts, perhaps the most important being development from a unicell, which minimizes conflicts from selection among cell lineages, and redistributes genetic variation arising within multicellular individuals between individuals. With a unicellular bottleneck, defecting cell lineages rarely succeed beyond the life span of the multicellular individual. When multicellularity arises through aggregation of scattered cells or when multicellular organisms fuse to form genetic chimeras, there are more opportunities for propagation of defector cell lineages. Intraorganismal competition may partly explain why multicellular organisms that develop by aggregation generally exhibit less differentiation than organisms that develop clonally.},

	abstract = {Australopithecines, dinosaurs, trilobites--such fossils conjure up images of lost worlds filled with vanished organisms. But in the full history of life, ancient animals, even the trilobites, form only the half-billion-year tip of a nearly four-billion-year iceberg. Andrew Knoll explores the deep history of life from its origins on a young planet to the incredible Cambrian explosion, presenting a compelling new explanation for the emergence of biological novelty. The very latest discoveries in paleontology--many of them made by the author and his students--are integrated with emerging insights from molecular biology and earth system science to forge a broad understanding of how the biological diversity that surrounds us came to be. Moving from Siberia to Namibia to the Bahamas, Knoll shows how life and environment have evolved together through Earth's history. Innovations in biology have helped shape our air and oceans, and, just as surely, environmental change has influenced the course of evolution, repeatedly closing off opportunities for some species while opening avenues for others. Readers go into the field to confront fossils, enter the lab to discern the inner workings of cells, and alight on Mars to ask how our terrestrial experience can guide exploration for life beyond our planet. Along the way, Knoll brings us up-to-date on some of science's hottest questions, from the oldest fossils and claims of life beyond the Earth to the hypothesis of global glaciation and Knoll's own unifying concept of ''permissive ecology.'' In laying bare Earth's deepest biological roots, Life on a Young Planet helps us understand our own place in the universe--and our responsibility as stewards of a world four billion years in the making.},

To date, however, how and when the group diversified has remained unclear. Here, we combine molecular phylogenetic and paleontological studies to elucidate the pattern and timing of early cyanobacterial diversification. 16S {rRNA}, {rbcL}, and {hetR} genes were sequenced from 20 cyanobacterial strains distributed among 16 genera, with particular care taken to represent the known diversity of filamentous taxa. Unlike most other bacteria, some filamentous cyanobacteria evolved a degree of cell differentiation, producing both specialized cells for nitrogen fixation (heterocysts) and resting cells able to endure environmental stress (akinetes). Phylogenetic analyses support the hypothesis that cyanobacteria capable of cell differentiation are monophyletic, and the geological record provides both upper and lower bounds on the origin of this clade. Fossil akinetes have been identified in 1,650- to 1,400-mega-annum (Ma) cherts from Siberia, China, and Australia, and what may be the earliest known akinetes are preserved in ≈2,100-Ma chert from West Africa. Geochemical evidence suggests that oxygen first reached levels that would compromise nitrogen fixation (and hence select for heterocyst differentiation) 2,450–2,320 Ma. Integrating phylogenetic analyses and geological data, we suggest that the clade of cyanobacteria marked by cell differentiation diverged once between 2,450 and 2,100 Ma, providing an internal bacterial calibration point for studies of molecular evolution in early organisms.},

For its first three billion years, life on Earth was a world of microscopic forms, rarely achieving a size greater than a millimetre or a complexity beyond two or three cell types. But in the past 600 million years, the evolution of much larger and more complex organisms has transformed the biosphere. Despite their disparate forms and physiologies, the evolution and diversification of plants, animals, fungi and other macroforms has followed similar global trends. One of the most important features underlying evolutionary increases in animal and plant size, complexity and diversity has been their modular construction from reiterated parts. Although simple filamentous and spherical forms may evolve wherever cellular life exists, the evolution of motile, modular mega-organisms might not be a universal pattern.

	abstract = {The enormous recent success of molecular developmental biology has yielded a vast amount of new information on the details of development. So much so that we risk losing sight of the underlying principles that apply to all development. To cut through this thicket, John Tyler Bonner ponders a moment in evolution when development was at its most basic--the moment when signaling between cells began. Although multicellularity arose numerous times, most of those events happened many millions of years ago. Many of the details of development that we see today, even in simple organisms, accrued over a long evolutionary timeline, and the initial events are obscured. The relatively uncomplicated and easy-to-grow cellular slime molds offer a unique opportunity to analyze development at a primitive stage and perhaps gain insight into how early multicellular development might have started.  Through slime molds, Bonner seeks a picture of the first elements of communication between cells. He asks what we have learned by looking at their developmental biology, including recent advances in our molecular understanding of the process. He then asks what is the most elementary way that polarity and pattern formation can be achieved. To find the answer, he uses models, including mathematical ones, to generate insights into how cell-to-cell cooperation might have originated. Students and scholars in the blossoming field of the evolution of development, as well as evolutionary biologists generally, will be interested in what Bonner has to say about the origins of multicellular development--and thus of the astounding biological complexity we now observe--and how best to study it.},

In flagellated colonial organisms such as the volvocalean green algae, organized beating by the somatic cells' flagella yields propulsion important in phototaxis and chemotaxis. It has not been generally appreciated that for the larger colonies flagellar stirring of boundary layers and remote transport are fundamental for maintaining a sufficient rate of metabolite turnover, one not attainable by diffusive transport alone. Here, we describe experiments that quantify the role of advective dynamics in enhancing productivity in germ soma-differentiated colonies. First, experiments with suspended deflagellated colonies of Volvox carteri show that forced advection improves productivity. Second, particle imaging velocimetry of fluid motion around colonies immobilized by micropipette aspiration reveals flow fields with very large characteristic velocities U extending to length scales exceeding the colony radius R. For a typical metabolite diffusion constant D, the associated Peclet number Pe = 2UR/D {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1, indicative of the dominance of advection over diffusion, with striking augmentation at the cell division stage. Near the colony surface, flows generated by flagella can be chaotic, exhibiting mixing due to stretching and folding. These results imply that hydrodynamic transport external to colonies provides a crucial boundary condition, a source for supplying internal diffusional dynamics.},

When competition exists, it is obvious that conflict arises; the emergence of cooperation, however, is less straightforward and calls for in-depth analysis. Much research is now focused on defining and expanding the evolutionary models of cooperation. Understanding the mechanisms of cooperation has relevance for fields other than biology. Anthropology, economics, mathematics, political science, primatology, and psychology are adopting the evolutionary approach and developing analogies based on it. Similarly, biologists use elements of economic game theory and analyze cooperation in "evolutionary games." Despite this, exchanges between researchers in these different disciplines have been limited. Seeking to fill this gap, the 90th Dahlem Workshop was convened. This book, which grew out of that meeting, addresses such topics as emotions in human cooperation, reciprocity, biological markets, cooperation and conflict in multicellularity, genomic and intercellular cooperation, the origins of human cooperation, and the cultural evolution of cooperation; the emphasis is on open questions and future research areas. The book makes a significant contribution to a growing process of interdisciplinary cross-fertilization on this issue.},

	isbn = {9780198502944},
	abstract = {During evolution, there have been several major changes in the way that genetic information is organized and transmitted from one generation to the next. These transitions include the origin of life itself, the first eukaryotic cells, reproduction by sexual means, the appearance of multicellular plants and animals, the emergence of cooperation and of animal societies, and the unique language ability of humans. This is the first book to discuss all of these major transitions. In discussing such a wide range of topics in one volume, the authors are able to highlight the similarities between different transitions - for example, between the union of replicating molecules to form chromosomes and of cells to form multicellular organisms. The authors also show how an understanding of one transition sheds light on others. A common theme in the book is that entities that could replicate independently before the transition can replicate afterwards only as part of a larger whole. Why, then, does selection between entities at the lower level not disrupt selection at the higher level? In answering this question, the authors offer an explanation for the evolution of cooperation at all levels of complexity. Written in a clear style, and illustrated with many original diagrams, this book can be read with enjoyment by anyone with an undergraduate training in the biological sciences. It will be ideal for advanced discussion groups on evolution. Although the content ranges widely from molecular biology to linguistics and from intragenomic conflict to insect societies, no detailed knowledge of any of these topics is required. Mathematical models are clearly explained, and equations and formulae are kept to a minimum.},

	abstract = {Multicellularity has evolved at least once in every major eukaryotic clade (in all ploidy levels) and numerous times among the prokaryotes. According to a standard multilevel selection ({MLS}) model, in each case, the evolution of multicellularity required the acquisition of cell–cell adhesion, communication, cooperation, and specialization attended by a compulsory alignment-of-fitness phase and an export-of-fitness phase to eliminate cell–cell conflict and to establish a reproductively integrated phenotype. These achievements are reviewed in terms of generalized evolutionary developmental motifs (or “modules”) whose overall logic constructs were mobilized and executed differently in bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals. When mapped onto a matrix of theoretically possible body plan morphologies (i.e., a morphospace), these motifs and the {MLS} model identify a “unicellular ⇒ colonial ⇒ multicellular” transformation series of body plans that mirrors trends observed in the majority of algae (i.e., a polyphyletic collection of photoautotrophic eukaryotes) and in the land plants, fungi, and animals. However, an alternative, more direct route to multicellularity theoretically exists, which may account for some aspects of fungal and algal evolution, i.e., a “siphonous ⇒ multicellular” transformation series. This review of multicellularity attempts to show that natural selection typically acts on functional traits rather than on the mechanisms that generate them (“Many roads lead to Rome.”) and that genome sequence homologies do not invariably translate into morphological homologies (“Rome isn’t what it used to be.”).},

It has been assumed that this early differentiation is related to size — the larger the organism the more cell types. Here two very different kinds of organisms are considered: the volvocine algae that become multicellular by growth, and the cellular slime moulds that become multicellular by aggregation. In both cases there are species that have only one cell type and others that have two. It has been possible to show that there is a perfect correlation with size: the forms with two cell types are significantly larger than those with one. Also in both groups there are forms of intermediate size that will vary from one to two cell types depending on the size of the individuals, suggesting a form of quorum sensing. These observations reinforce the view that size plays a critical role in influencing the degree of differentiation.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

It is based on a model of genome evolution that suggests that the origin of complex phenotypic innovations will be accompanied by the emergence of such founder genes, the descendants of which can still be traced in extant organisms. The origin of multicellularity can be considered to be a macroevolutionary transition, for which new gene functions would have been required. Cancer should be tightly connected to multicellular life since it can be viewed as a malfunction of interaction between cells in a multicellular organism. A phylostratigraphic tracking of the origin of cancer genes should, therefore, also provide insights into the origin of multicellularity.

	abstract = {The basic problem in an evolutionary transition is to understand how a group of individuals becomes a new kind of individual, possessing the property of heritable variation in fitness at the new level of organization. During an evolutionary transition, for example, from single cells to multicellular organisms, the new higher-level evolutionary unit (multicellular organism) gains its emergent properties by virtue of the interactions among lower-level units (cells). We see the formation of cooperative interactions among lower-level units as a necessary step in evolutionary transitions; only cooperation transfers fitness from lower levels (costs to group members) to higher levels (benefits to the group). As cooperation creates new levels of fitness, it creates the opportunity for conflict between levels as deleterious mutants arise and spread within the group. Fundamental to the emergence of a new higher-level unit is the mediation of conflict among lower-level units in favor of the higher-level unit. The acquisition of heritable variation in fitness at the new level, via conflict mediation, requires the reorganization of the basic components of fitness (survival and reproduction) and life-properties (such as immortality and totipotency) as well as the co-option of lower-level processes for new functions at the higher level. The way in which the conflicts associated with the transition in individuality have been mediated, and fitness and general life-traits have been re-organized, can influence the potential for further evolution (i.e., evolvability) of the newly emerged evolutionary individual. We use the volvocalean green algal group as a model-system to understand evolutionary transitions in individuality and to apply and test the theoretical principles presented above. Lastly, we discuss how the different notions of individuality stem from the basic properties of fitness in a multilevel selection context.},

We hypothesize that cancer is an atavistic condition that occurs when genetic or epigenetic malfunction unlocks an ancient 'toolkit' of pre-existing adaptations, re-establishing the dominance of an earlier layer of genes that controlled loose-knit colonies of only partially differentiated cells, similar to tumors. The existence of such a toolkit implies that the progress of the neoplasm in the host organism differs distinctively from normal Darwinian evolution. Comparative genomics and the phylogeny of basal metazoans, opisthokonta and basal multicellular eukaryotes should help identify the relevant genes and yield the order in which they evolved. This order will be a rough guide to the reverse order in which cancer develops, as mutations disrupt the genes of cellular cooperation. Our proposal is consistent with current understanding of cancer and explains the paradoxical rapidity with which cancer acquires a suite of mutually-supportive complex abilities. Finally we make several predictions and suggest ways to test this model.},

The associated changes in gene expression patterns exhibit time-directionality. This "arrow of time" in the collective change of gene expression across multiple stable gene expression patterns (attractors) is not explained by the regulated activation, the suppression of individual genes which are bidirectional molecular processes, or by the standard dynamical models of the underlying gene circuit which only account for local stability of attractors. To capture the global dynamics of this nonequilibrium system and gain insight in the time-asymmetry of state transitions, we computed the quasipotential landscape of the stochastic dynamics of a canonical gene circuit that governs branching cell fate commitment. The potential landscape reveals the global dynamics and permits the calculation of potential barriers between cell phenotypes imposed by the circuit architecture. The generic asymmetry of barrier heights indicates that the transition from the uncommitted multipotent state to differentiated states is inherently unidirectional. The model agrees with observations and predicts the extreme conditions for reprogramming cells back to the undifferentiated state.},

	abstract = {Individuality is a complex trait, yet a series of stages each advantageous in itself can be shown to exist allowing evolution to get from unicellular individuals to multicellular individuals. We consider several of the key stages involved in this transition: the initial advantage of group formation, the origin of reproductive altruism within the group, and the further specialization of cell types as groups increase in size. How do groups become individuals? This is the central question we address. Our hypothesis is that fitness tradeoffs drive the transition of a cell group into a multicellular individual through the evolution of cells specialized at reproductive and vegetative functions of the group. We have modeled this hypothesis and have tested our models in two ways. We have studied the origin of the genetic basis for reproductive altruism (somatic cells specialized at vegetative functions) in the multicellular Volvox carteri by showing how an altruistic gene may have originated through cooption of a life-history tradeoff gene present in a unicellular ancestor. Second, we ask why reproductive altruism and individuality arise only in the larger members of the volvocine group (recognizing that high levels of kinship are present in all volvocine algae groups). Our answer is that the selective pressures leading to reproductive altruism stem from the increasing cost of reproduction with increasing group size. Concepts from population genetics and evolutionary biology appear to be sufficient to explain complexity, at least as it relates to the problem of the major transitions between the different kinds of evolutionary individuals.},

Since its functional loss results in impaired differentiation in the nervous, hematopoietic, and muscular systems, the Rb protein is very important for cell regulation in multicellular eukaryotes. To gain an insight into the evolutionary history of the Rb gene, I have compared the amino acid sequences of Rb proteins in multicellular eukaryotes and unicellular organisms including yeast, archaeotes, and viruses. Two short amino acid sequences, in the N-terminal and pocket A regions of human Rb protein, found to be well conserved, also in a single protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These sequences were also found in proteins of two archaeotes, Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Methanococcus jannaschii. Further, the most conserved sequence in the pocket B region among multicellular eukaryotic Rb proteins was also conserved in several poxviruses. From these data, I conclude that the pocket A and B regions, backbones of the Rb protein, are derived from different organisms, respectively, the ancestors of archaeote and poxvirus, and that the ancestral pocket B region has been lost during evolutionary history of unicellular eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Ideas of homeostasis derive from the concept of the organism as an open system. These ideas can be traced back to Heraclitus. Hopkins, Bernard, Hill, Cannon, Weiner and von Bertalanffy developed further the mechanistic basis of turnover of biological components, and Schoenheimer and Rittenberg were pioneers of experimental approaches to the problems of measuring pool sizes and dynamic fluxes. From the second half of the twentieth century, a biophysical theory mainly founded on self-organisation and Dynamic Systems Theory allowed us to approach the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the organised complexity that characterises living systems. This combination of theoretical framework and more refined experimental techniques revealed that feedback control of steady states is a mode of operation that, although providing stability, is only one of many modes and may be the exception rather than the rule. The concept of homeodynamics that we introduce here offers a radically new and all-embracing concept that departs from the classical homeostatic idea that emphasises the stability of the internal milieu toward perturbation. Indeed, biological systems are homeody- namic because of their ability to dynamically self-organise at bifurcation points of their behaviour where they lose stability. Consequently, they exhibit diverse behaviour; in addition to monotonic stationary states, living systems display complex behaviour with all its emergent characteristics, i.e., bistable switches, thresholds, waves, gradients, mutual entrainment, and periodic as well as chaotic behaviour, as evidenced in cellular phenomena such as dynamic (supra)molecular organisation and flux coordination. These processes may proceed on different spatial scales, as well as across time scales, from the very rapid processes within and between molecules in membranes to the slow time scales of evolutionary change. It is dynamic organisation under homeodynamic conditions that make possible the organised complexity of life.},

Here we explore this concept by means of a simple mathematical model. It is shown that an error threshold exists in this model, which investigates both competition between cancer cell populations and its impact on overall tumor growth dynamics. Once the threshold is reached, the highly unstable tumor cell populations, which were sustaining malignant growth, become unable to maintain their genetic information, which in turn triggers a slowed down overall tumor growth regime.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced genome theory of cancer evolution provides a new framework for evolutionary studies on cancer. In particular, the established relationship between the large number of individual molecular mechanisms and the general evolutionary mechanism of cancer calls upon a change in our strategies that have been based on the characterization of common cancer gene mutations and their defined pathways. To further explain the significance of the genome theory of cancer evolution, a brief review will be presented describing the various attempts to illustrate the evolutionary mechanism of cancer, followed by further analysis of some key components of somatic cell evolution, including the diversity of biological systems, the multiple levels of information systems and control systems, the two phases (the punctuated or discontinuous phase and gradual Darwinian stepwise phase) and dynamic patterns of somatic cell evolution where genome replacement is the driving force. By linking various individual molecular mechanisms to the level of genome population diversity and tumorigenicity, the general mechanism of cancer has been identified as the evolutionary mechanism of cancer, which can be summarized by the following three steps including stress-induced genome instability, population diversity or heterogeneity, and genome-mediated macroevolution. Interestingly, the evolutionary mechanism is equal to the collective aggregate of all individual molecular mechanisms. This relationship explains why most of the known molecular mechanisms can contribute to cancer yet there is no single dominant mechanism for the majority of clinical cases. Despite the fact that each molecular mechanism can serve as a system stress and initiate the evolutionary process, to achieve cancer, multiple cycles of genome-mediated macroevolution are required and are a stochastically determined event. Finally, the potential clinical implications of the evolutionary mechanism of cancer are briefly reviewed.},

When macromolecules grow large and complex enough to exhibit some plasticity, however, the subsequent directions in which these molecules change may be guided more by the nexus of chemical reactions in which they participate. In particular, configurations of autocatalytic reactions among plastic macromolecules can come to exert more agency upon the component reactants and mechanisms than vice versa, and the nexus of such processes retains its identity longer than do the latter, more transient participants. Whence, the ascendancy of autocatalytic forms as causal agencies provides a natural example of the phenomenon of ‘emergence’ and affords a way out of the conundrums that currently obfuscate the issue of the origin of life.},

Because mutation is the ultimate source of the genetic variation required for adaptation, it can be appealing to suppose that the genomic mutation rate is adjusted to a level that best promotes adaptation. Most mutations with phenotypic effects are harmful, however, and thus there is relentless selection within populations for lower genomic mutation rates. Selection on beneficial mutations can counter this effect by favoring alleles that raise the mutation rate, but the effect of beneficial mutations on the genomic mutation rate is extremely sensitive to recombination and is unlikely to be important in sexual populations. In contrast, high genomic mutation rates can evolve in asexual populations under the influence of beneficial mutations, but this phenomenon is probably of limited adaptive significance and represents, at best, a temporary reprieve from the continual selection pressure to reduce mutation. The physiological cost of reducing mutation below the low level observed in most populations may be the most important factor in setting the genomic mutation rate in sexual and asexual systems, regardless of the benefits of mutation in producing new adaptive variation. Maintenance of mutation rates higher than the minimum set by this "cost of fidelity" is likely only under special circumstances.},

The acquired genetic insta0ility and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment.

The inherently Darwinian character of cancer is the primary reason for this therapeutic failure, but it may also hold the key to more effective control.},

Though the emerging data from these studies are illuminating, their reconciliation with epidemiologic and clinical observations poses a major challenge. In the current study, we provide a mathematical model that begins to address this challenge. We model tumors as a discrete time branching process that starts with a single driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal expansion. Using the model, we observe tremendous variation in the rate of tumor development—providing an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes and development times that have been observed by epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the model provides a simple formula for the number of driver mutations as a function of the total number of mutations in the tumor. Finally, when applied to recent experimental data, the model allows us to calculate the actual selective advantage provided by typical somatic mutations in human tumors in situ. This selective advantage is surprisingly small—0.004 ± 0.0004—and has major implications for experimental cancer research.},

Methylation patterns were polymorphic but differences were similar between different parts of the same tumor, consistent with relatively isotropic or “flat” clonal expansions that could be simulated by rapid initial population expansions. Methylation patterns were too diverse to be consistent with very rare cancer stem cells but were more consistent with multiple (≈4 to 1,000) long-lived cancer stem cell lineages per cancer gland.

Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2\%–3\% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in ∼25\% of bone cancers.

	abstract = {Summary
All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the {DNA} damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with {BRCA}1 or {BRCA}2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed “kataegis,” was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at {TpC} dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.

	abstract = {The incidence of clinically detected prostate cancer is increasing with more frequent diagnosis in younger male patients. Whether this represents a genuine increase in incidence or earlier detection is not clear. To understand better the evolution and early changes of prostate cancer we evaluated 152 prostate glands from young male patients 10 to 49 years old. Of the prostates 98 were from African-Americans and 54 were from white patients. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was identified in 0\%, 9\%, 20 and 44\%, and small foci of histological cancer in 0\%, 0\%, 27\% and 34\% of the male patients in the second, third, fourth and fifth decades of age, respectively. The majority of the cases of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were of low grade. High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, found in 5 prostates, was first identified in the fifth decade. All 5 cases occurred in prostates containing histological carcinoma. Incidental carcinoma was detected with a similar frequency in white and black patients. The cancerous foci were of similar size with a tendency for cancer in black patients to be multifocal, particularly in those in the fifth decade. We conclude that prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and histological cancers are surprisingly common in young male patients of both races. The evolution of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and focal histological cancers is not clear but it appears to present several decades earlier than clinically detected carcinoma. The natural history of prostate cancer must encompass many more years (decades) than has been previously realized. In addition, the initiating events leading to clinically relevant prostate cancers likely occur at a remarkably young age.},

	abstract = {The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1), observed in greater than 90\% of chronic myelogenous leukemia ({CML}) patients, results from a specific chromosomal translocation involving the c-abl gene. The translocation breakpoint occurs near c-abl and correlates with the production of an altered c-abl {mRNA}. In the {CML}-derived cell line K562, Ph1 is accompanied by a structurally altered c-abl protein (P210c-abl) with in vitro tyrosine kinase activity not detected with the normal c-abl protein (P145c-abl). We have examined c-abl proteins in other Ph1-positive {CML} cell lines and found that they all express P210c-abl. P210c-abl was also detected in bone marrow cells from {CML} patients with Ph1 in the accelerated and blast crisis phases of the disease. Comparison of the [35S]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides generated from the normal P145c-abl and P210c-abl showed that they have closely related structures, but additional polypeptide sequences are present in P210c-abl. Based on these results we propose that translocation of c-abl in Ph1-positive {CML} results in the creation of a chimeric gene leading to the production of a structurally altered c-abl protein with activated tyrosine kinase activity. The altered P210 c-abl protein is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of {CML}.},

The sites of the recombination on chromosome 14 are located close to the 5' end of the involved {JH} segment, where the diversity (D) regions are rearranged with the {JH} segments in the production of active heavy-chain genes. As extraneous nucleotides (N regions) were observed at joining sites and specific signal-like sequences were detected on chromosome 18 in close proximity to the breakpoints, it is concluded that the t(14;18) chromosome translocation is the result of a mistake during the process of {VDJ} joining at the pre-B-cell stage of differentiation.

The translocation resulted in a precise rearrangement of sequences on chromosome 8 and what appears to be a functional J alpha segment on chromosome 14. Signal sequences for V-J joining occurred at the breakpoint positions on both chromosomes 14 and 8, suggesting that the translocation occurs during {TCR} gene rearrangement and that it is catalyzed by the enzymatic systems involved in V-J joining reactions. The involvement of c-myc in the translocation and the association of joining signals at the breakpoints provides a parallel to the situation observed in the translocations involving c-myc and the immunoglobulin loci in B-cell neoplasms and suggests that common mechanisms of translocation and oncogene deregulation are involved in B- and T-cell malignancies.},

Neural cancers display cellular hierarchies with self-renewing tumorigenic cancer stem cells ({CSCs}) at the apex. Instructive cues to maintain {CSCs} are generated by both intrinsic networks and the niche microenvironment. The {CSC}-microenvironment relationship is complex, as {CSCs} can modify their environment and extrinsic forces induce plasticity in the cellular hierarchy.},

In the present review, we attempt to bring together these subjects in a general systems biology narrative. It starts from the roles of what we term entropy of signaling and noise in the initial oncogenic events, to the first major transition of tumorigenesis: the independence of the tumor cell and the switch in its physiology, i.e., from subservience to the organism to its own independent Darwinian evolution. The development after independence involves a constant dynamic reprogramming of the cells and the emergence of a sort of collective intelligence leading to invasion and metastasis and seldom to the ultimate acquisition of immortality through inter-individual infection. At each step, the probability of success is minimal to infinitesimal, but the number of cells possibly involved and the time scale account for the relatively high occurrence of tumorigenesis and metastasis in multicellular organisms.},

Myc and its dimerization partner Max are {bHLH}-Zip {DNA} binding proteins controlling fundamental cellular processes. Deregulation of c-myc leads to tumorigenesis and is a hallmark of many human cancers. We have identified and extensively characterized ancestral forms of myc and max genes from the early diploblastic cnidarian Hydra, the most primitive metazoan organism employed so far for the structural, functional, and evolutionary analysis of these genes. Hydra myc is specifically activated in all stem cells and nematoblast nests which represent the rapidly proliferating cell types of the interstitial stem cell system and in proliferating gland cells. In terminally differentiated nerve cells, nematocytes, or epithelial cells, myc expression is not detectable by in situ hybridization. Hydra max exhibits a similar expression pattern in interstitial cell clusters. The ancestral Hydra Myc and Max proteins display the principal design of their vertebrate derivatives, with the highest degree of sequence identities confined to the {bHLH}-Zip domains. Furthermore, the 314-amino acid Hydra Myc protein contains basic forms of the essential Myc boxes I through {III}. A recombinant Hydra Myc/Max complex binds to the consensus {DNA} sequence {CACGTG} with high affinity. Hybrid proteins composed of segments from the retroviral v-Myc oncoprotein and the Hydra Myc protein display oncogenic potential in cell transformation assays. Our results suggest that the principal functions of the Myc master regulator arose very early in metazoan evolution, allowing their dissection in a simple model organism showing regenerative ability but no senescence.},

This approach has made valuable contributions to a wide variety of disciplines, including political science, economics, and evolutionary biology. Existing cancer theory suggests that individual clones of cancer cells evolve independently from one another, acquiring all of the genetic traits or hallmarks necessary to form a malignant tumor. It is also now recognized that tumors are heterotypic, with cancer cells interacting with normal stromal cells within the tissue microenvironment, including endothelial, stromal, and nerve cells. This tumor cell–stromal cell interaction in itself is a form of commensalism, because it has been demonstrated that these nonmalignant cells support and even enable tumor growth. Here, we add to this theory by regarding tumor cells as game players whose interactions help to determine their Darwinian fitness. We marshal evidence that tumor cells overcome certain host defenses by means of diffusible products. Our original contribution is to raise the possibility that two nearby cells can protect each other from a set of host defenses that neither could survive alone. Cooperation can evolve as by-product mutualism among genetically diverse tumor cells. Our hypothesis supplements, but does not supplant, the traditional view of carcinogenesis in which one clonal population of cells develops all of the necessary genetic traits independently to form a tumor. Cooperation through the sharing of diffusible products raises new questions about tumorigenesis and has implications for understanding observed phenomena, designing new experiments, and developing new therapeutic approaches.},

However, a "division of labor" leading to cooperation among tumor-cell subpopulations could be an additional catalyst of progression. Using a zebrafish-melanoma xenograft model, we found that in a heterogeneous setting, inherently invasive cells, which possess protease activity and deposit extracellular matrix ({ECM}), co-invade with subpopulations of poorly invasive cells, a phenomenon we term "cooperative invasion". Whereas the poorly invasive cells benefit from heterogeneity, the invasive cells switch from protease-independent to an {MT}1-{MMP}-dependent mode of invasion. We did not observe changes in expression of the melanoma phenotype determinant {MITF} during cooperative invasion, thus ruling out the necessity for phenotype switching for invasion. Altogether, our data suggest that cooperation can drive melanoma progression without the need for clonal selection or phenotype switching and can account for the preservation of heterogeneity seen throughout tumor progression.},

	abstract = {Cancer genome sequencing studies indicate that a single breast cancer typically harbours multiple genetically distinct subclones. As carcinogenesis involves a breakdown in the cell–cell cooperation that normally maintains epithelial tissue architecture, individual subclones within a malignant microenvironment are commonly depicted as self-interested competitors. Alternatively, breast cancer subclones might interact cooperatively to gain a selective growth advantage in some cases. Although interclonal cooperation has been shown to drive tumorigenesis in fruitfly models, definitive evidence for functional cooperation between epithelial tumour cell subclones in mammals is lacking. Here we use mouse models of breast cancer to show that interclonal cooperation can be essential for tumour maintenance. Aberrant expression of the secreted signalling molecule Wnt1 generates mixed-lineage mammary tumours composed of basal and luminal tumour cell subtypes, which purportedly derive from a bipotent malignant progenitor cell residing atop a tumour cell hierarchy. Using somatic Hras mutations as clonal markers, we show that some Wnt tumours indeed conform to a hierarchical configuration, but that others unexpectedly harbour genetically distinct basal Hras mutant and luminal Hras wild-type subclones. Both subclones are required for efficient tumour propagation, which strictly depends on luminally produced Wnt1. When biclonal tumours were challenged with Wnt withdrawal to simulate targeted therapy, analysis of tumour regression and relapse revealed that basal subclones recruit heterologous Wnt-producing cells to restore tumour growth. Alternatively, in the absence of a substitute Wnt source, the original subclones often evolve to rescue Wnt pathway activation and drive relapse, either by restoring cooperation or by switching to a defector strategy. Uncovering similar modes of interclonal cooperation in human cancers may inform efforts aimed at eradicating tumour cell communities.},

Here we present the draft genome sequence of Amphimedon queenslandica, a demosponge from the Great Barrier Reef, and show that it is remarkably similar to other animal genomes in content, structure and organization. Comparative analysis enabled by the sequencing of the sponge genome reveals genomic events linked to the origin and early evolution of animals, including the appearance, expansion and diversification of pan-metazoan transcription factor, signalling pathway and structural genes. This diverse 'toolkit' of genes correlates with critical aspects of all metazoan body plans, and comprises cell cycle control and growth, development, somatic- and germ-cell specification, cell adhesion, innate immunity and allorecognition. Notably, many of the genes associated with the emergence of animals are also implicated in cancer, which arises from defects in basic processes associated with metazoan multicellularity.},

A near-universal property of primary and metastatic cancers is upregulation of glycolysis, resulting in increased glucose consumption, which can be observed with clinical tumour imaging. We propose that persistent metabolism of glucose to lactate even in aerobic conditions is an adaptation to intermittent hypoxia in pre-malignant lesions. However, upregulation of glycolysis leads to microenvironmental acidosis requiring evolution to phenotypes resistant to acid-induced cell toxicity. Subsequent cell populations with upregulated glycolysis and acid resistance have a powerful growth advantage, which promotes unconstrained proliferation and invasion.},

The second is discussed in this review. {CSC} are defined as cells having three properties: a selectively endowed tumorigenic capacity, an ability to recreate the full repertoire of cancer cells of the parent tumor and the expression of a distinctive repertoire of surface biomarkers. In operational terms, the {CSC} are among all cancer cells those able to initiate a xenotransplant. Other explicit or implicit assumptions exist, including the concept of {CSC} as a single unique infrequent population of cells. To avoid such assumptions, we propose to use the operational term tumor-propagating cells ({TPC}); indeed, the cells that initiate transplants did not initiate the cancer. The experimental evidence supporting the explicit definition is analyzed. Cancers indeed contain a fraction of cells mainly responsible for the tumor development. However, there is evidence that these cells do not represent one homogenous population. Moreover, there is no evidence that the derived cells result from an asymmetric, qualitative and irreversible process. A more general model is proposed of which the {CSC} model could be one extreme case. We propose that the {TPC} are multiple evolutionary selected cancer cells with the most competitive properties [maintained by (epi-)genetic mechanisms], at least partially reversible, quantitative rather than qualitative and resulting from a stochastic rather than deterministic process.},

These tumor-initiating cells could provide a resource for cells that cause tumor recurrence after therapy. Although the cell origin of {CSCs} remains to be fully elucidated, mounting evidence has demonstrated that Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition ({EMT}), induced by different factors, is associated with tumor aggressiveness and metastasis and these cells share molecular characteristics with {CSCs}, and thus are often called cancer stem-like cells or tumor-initiating cells. The acquisition of an {EMT} phenotype is a critical process for switching early stage carcinomas into invasive malignancies, which is often associated with the loss of epithelial differentiation and gain of mesenchymal phenotype. Recent studies have demonstrated that {EMT} plays a critical role not only in tumor metastasis but also in tumor recurrence and that it is tightly linked with the biology of cancer stem-like cells or cancer-initiating cells. Here we will succinctly summarize the state-of-our-knowledge regarding the molecular similarities between cancer stem-like cells or {CSCs} and {EMT}-phenotypic cells that are associated with tumor aggressiveness focusing on solid tumors.},

Through this property, striking parallels can be found between stem cells and cancer cells: tumours may often originate from the transformation of normal stem cells, similar signalling pathways may regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and cancer cells may include 'cancer stem cells' - rare cells with indefinite potential for self-renewal that drive tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {Although the concept that cancers arise from “stem cells” or “germ cells” was first proposed about 150 years ago, it is only recently that advances in stem cell biology have given new impetus to the “cancer stem cell hypothesis.” Two important related concepts of this hypothesis are that (a) tumors originate in either tissue stem cells or their immediate progeny through dysregulation of the normally tightly regulated process of self-renewal. As a result of this, (b) tumors contain a cellular subcomponent that retains key stem cell properties. These properties include self-renewal, which drives tumorigenesis, and differentiation albeit aberrant that contributes to cellular heterogeneity. Recent experimental evidence in a variety of tumors has lent strong support to the cancer stem cell hypothesis that represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of carcinogenesis and tumor cell biology. This hypothesis has fundamental implications for cancer risk assessment, early detection, prognostication, and prevention. Furthermore, the current development of cancer therapeutics based on tumor regression may have produced agents that kill differentiated tumor cells while sparing the rare cancer stem cell population. The development of more effective cancer therapies may thus require targeting this important cell population. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(4): 1883-90)},

These cancerous cells then grow clonally into tumors and eventually have the potential to metastasize. A central question in cancer biology is, which cells can be transformed to form tumors? Recent studies elucidated the presence of cancer stem cells that have the exclusive ability to regenerate tumors. These cancer stem cells share many characteristics with normal stem cells, including self-renewal and differentiation. With the growing evidence that cancer stem cells exist in a wide array of tumors, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and differentiation because corruption of genes involved in these pathways likely participates in tumor growth. This new paradigm of oncogenesis has been validated in a growing list of tumors. Studies of normal and cancer stem cells from the same tissue have shed light on the ontogeny of tumors. That signaling pathways such as Bmi1 and Wnt have similar effects in normal and cancer stem cell self-renewal suggests that common molecular pathways regulate both populations. Understanding the biology of cancer stem cells will contribute to the identification of molecular targets important for future therapies.},

Our data show that accumulation of a detectable level of mutant p53 proteins occurs first in neural stem cells in the subventricular zone ({SVZ}) and that subsequent expansion of mutant p53-expressing Olig2(+) transit-amplifying progenitor-like cells in the {SVZ}-associated areas initiates glioma formation.},

	issn = {0027-8874},
	shorttitle = {The causes of cancer},
	abstract = {Evidence that the various common types of cancer are largely avoidable diseases is reviewed. Life-style and other environmental factors are divided into a dozen categories, and for each category the evidence relating those particular factors to cancer onset rates is summarized. Where possible, an estimate is made of the percentage of current U.S. cancer mortality that might have been caused or avoided by that category of factors. These estimates are based chiefly on evidence from epidemiology, as the available evidence from animal and other laboratory studies cannot provide reliable human risk assessments. By far the largest reliably known percentage is the 30\% of current U.S. cancer deaths that are due to tobacco, although it is possible that some nutritional factor(s) may eventually be found to be of comparable importance. The percentage of U.S. cancer deaths that are due to tobacco is still increasing, and must be expected to continue to increase for some years yet due to the delayed effects of the adoption of cigarettes in earlier decades. Trends in mortality and in onset rates for many separate types of cancer are studied in detail in appendixes to this paper. Biases in the available data on registration of new cases produce apparent trends in cancer incidence which are spurious. Biases also produce spurious trends in cancer incidence which are spurious. Biases also produce spurious trends in cancer death certification rates, especially among old people. In (and before) middle age, where the biases are smaller, there appear to be a few real increases and a few real decreases in mortality from some particular types of cancer, but there is no evidence of any generalized increase other than that due to tobacco. Moderate increases or decreases due to some new agent(s) or habit(s) might of course be overlooked in such large-scale analyses. But, such analyses do suggest that, apart from cancer of the respiratory tract, the types of cancer that are currently common are not peculiarly modern diseases and are likely to depend chiefly on some long-established factor(s). (A prospective study utilizing both questionnaires and stored blood and other biological materials might help elucidate these factors.) The proportion of current U.S. cancer deaths attributed to occupational factors is provisionally estimated as 4\% (lung cancer being the major contributor to this). This is far smaller than has recently been suggested by various U.S. Government agencies. The matter could be resolved directly by a "case-control" study of lung cancer two or three times larger than the recently completed U.S. National Bladder Cancer Study but similar to it in methodology and unit costs; there are also other reasons for such a study. A fuller summary of conclusions and recommendations comprises the final section of this report.},

	abstract = {{WINNER} {OF} {THE} {PULITZER} {PRIZEThe} Emperor of All Maladies is a magnificent, profoundly humane “biography” of cancer—from its first documented appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in the twentieth century to cure, control, and conquer it to a radical new understanding of its essence. Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist’s precision, a historian’s perspective, and a biographer’s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with—and perished from—for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave may have cut off her diseased breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee’s own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. Riveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.},

In our view, the best single measure of progress against cancer is change in the age-adjusted mortality rate associated with all cancers combined in the total population. According to this measure, we are losing the war against cancer, notwithstanding progress against several uncommon forms of the disease, improvements in palliation, and extension of the productive years of life. A shift in research emphasis, from research on treatment to research on prevention, seems necessary if substantial progress against cancer is to be forthcoming.},

The mechanism relied on the ability of tumour derived {HSP}70 to associate with antigenic peptides, which, when cross presented, elicited a T cell mediated antitumour response. Subsequently, {HSP}70 was incorrectly described as a potent adjuvant of innate immunity, and although mistakes in the experimental approaches were exposed and associated with endotoxin contamination in the recombinant {HSP}70 specimen, questions still remain regarding this matter. Here we review only publications that have cautiously addressed the endotoxin contamination problem in {HSP}70 in order to reveal the real immunological function of the protein. Accordingly, \&\#x201c;endotoxin free\&\#x201d; {HSP}70 stimulates macrophages and delivers antigenic peptides to {APCs}, which effectively prime T cells mediating an antitumour reaction. Conversely, {HSP}70 has potent anti-inflammatory functions as follows: regulating T cell responses, reducing stimulatory capacity of {DCs}, and inducing development of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. These activities were further associated with the immune evasive mechanism of tumours and implicated in the modulation of immune reactivity in autoimmune diseases and transplant-related clinical conditions. Consequently, the role of {HSP}70 in immune regulation is newly emerging and contrary to what was previously anticipated.},

It was, however, four World War {II}–related programs, and the effects of drugs that evolved from them, that provided the impetus to establish in 1955 the national drug development effort known as the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center. The ability of combination chemotherapy to cure acute childhood leukemia and advanced Hodgkin's disease in the 1960s and early 1970s overcame the prevailing pessimism about the ability of drugs to cure advanced cancers, facilitated the study of adjuvant chemotherapy, and helped foster the national cancer program. Today, chemotherapy has changed as important molecular abnormalities are being used to screen for potential new drugs as well as for targeted treatments. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):8643–53]},

	abstract = {Purpose High doses of effective chemotherapy are compelling if they can be delivered safely. Substantial interest in supporting high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in the 1980s and 1990s led to the initiation of randomized trials to evaluate its effect in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
Methods We identified six randomized trials in metastatic breast cancer that evaluated high doses of chemotherapy with transplant support versus a control regimen without stem-cell support. We assembled a single database containing individual patient information from these trials. The primary analysis of overall survival was a log-rank test comparing high dose versus control. We also used Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for known covariates. We addressed potential treatment differences within subsets of patients.
Results The effect of high-dose chemotherapy on overall survival was not statistically different (median, 2.16 v 2.02 years; P = .08). A statistically significant advantage in progression-free survival (median, 0.91 v 0.69 years) did not translate into survival benefit. Subset analyses found little evidence that there are groups of patients who might benefit from high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic support.
Conclusion Overall survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer in the six randomized trials was not significantly improved by high-dose chemotherapy; any benefit from high doses was small. No identifiable subset of patients seems to benefit from high-dose chemotherapy.},

These modifications have been studied to develop epigenome-targeted therapies and new diagnostic tools. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved four epigenome-targeted anticancer drugs. Two are drugs that inhibit {DNA} methyltransferases: azacitidine and decitabine, and two are drugs that inhibit histone deacetylases: vorinostat and romidepsin. These initial successes demonstrate the potential effectiveness of epigenome-targeted therapies as monotherapy in hematologic malignancies, but newer studies are focused on combination therapy in many cancers. Epigenetic modifications have also been used to evaluate potential biomarkers to diagnose patients with cancer, identify patient populations likely to respond to specific anticancer therapies, and select reasonable dosages for investigational anticancer drugs, as observed with other newer targeted anticancer drugs. Although much has been learned about the relationship between the epigenome and cancer, many questions remain unanswered at this time. The next step is to continue to translate emerging epigenetic knowledge into anticancer drug development. In this review, we discuss the role of epigenetic modifications in the development of cancer and anticancer drug resistance, and we describe the progress and challenges associated with developing epigenome-targeted anticancer drugs and diagnostic tools that identify epigenetic modifications.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that systemic neoplastic spread is a late event in tumour progression. However, sometimes, rapidly invasive cancers are diagnosed because of appearance of metastatic lesions in absence of a clearly detectable primary mass. This kind of disease is referred to as cancer of unknown primary ({CUP}) origin and accounts for 3-5\% of all cancer diagnosis. There is poor consensus on the extent of diagnostic and pathologic evaluations required for these enigmatic cases which still lack effective treatment. Although technology to predict the primary tumour site of origin is improving rapidly, the key issue is concerning the biology which drives early occult metastatic spreading. This review provides the state of the art about clinical and therapeutic management of this malignant syndrome; main interest is addressed to the most recent improvements in {CUP} molecular biology and pathology, which will lead to successful tailored therapeutic options.

	abstract = {Background Both the validity and the reproducibility of microarray-based clinical research have been challenged. There is a need for critical review of the statistical analysis and reporting in published microarray studies that focus on cancer-related clinical outcomes.
Methods Studies published through 2004 in which microarray-based gene expression profiles were analyzed for their relation to a clinical cancer outcome were identified through a Medline search followed by hand screening of abstracts and full text articles. Studies that were eligible for our analysis addressed one or more outcomes that were either an event occurring during follow-up, such as death or relapse, or a therapeutic response. We recorded descriptive characteristics for all the selected studies. A critical review of outcome-related statistical analyses was undertaken for the articles published in 2004.
Results Ninety studies were identified, and their descriptive characteristics are presented. Sixty-eight (76\%) were published in journals of impact factor greater than 6. A detailed account of the 42 studies (47\%) published in 2004 is reported. Twenty-one (50\%) of them contained at least one of the following three basic flaws: 1) in outcome-related gene finding, an unstated, unclear, or inadequate control for multiple testing; 2) in class discovery, a spurious claim of correlation between clusters and clinical outcome, made after clustering samples using a selection of outcome-related differentially expressed genes; or 3) in supervised prediction, a biased estimation of the prediction accuracy through an incorrect cross-validation procedure.
Conclusions The most common and serious mistakes and misunderstandings recorded in published studies are described and illustrated. Based on this analysis, a proposal of guidelines for statistical analysis and reporting for clinical microarray studies, presented as a checklist of “Do's and Don'ts,” is provided.},

	abstract = {Summary
The success of treatment of patients with cancer depends on establishing an accurate diagnosis. To this end, we have built a system called {GEMS} (gene expression model selector) for the automated development and evaluation of high-quality cancer diagnostic models and biomarker discovery from microarray gene expression data. In order to determine and equip the system with the best performing diagnostic methodologies in this domain, we first conducted a comprehensive evaluation of classification algorithms using 11 cancer microarray datasets. In this paper we present a preliminary evaluation of the system with five new datasets. The performance of the models produced automatically by {GEMS} is comparable or better than the results obtained by human analysts. Additionally, we performed a cross-dataset evaluation of the system. This involved using a dataset to build a diagnostic model and to estimate its future performance, then applying this model and evaluating its performance on a different dataset. We found that models produced by {GEMS} indeed perform well in independent samples and, furthermore, the cross-validation performance estimates output by the system approximate well the error obtained by the independent validation. {GEMS} is freely available for download for non-commercial use from http://www.gems-system.org.},

	abstract = {In cancer studies, it is common that multiple microarray experiments are conducted to measure the same clinical outcome and expressions of the same set of genes. An important goal of such experiments is to identify a subset of genes that can potentially serve as predictive markers for cancer development and progression. Analyses of individual experiments may lead to unreliable gene selection results because of the small sample sizes. Meta analysis can be used to pool multiple experiments, increase statistical power, and achieve more reliable gene selection. The meta analysis of cancer microarray data is challenging because of the high dimensionality of gene expressions and the differences in experimental settings amongst different experiments.

However, diverse breast cancer datasets in conjunction with diagnostic clinical arrays show little overlap in the sets of genes identified. One approach to identify a set of consistently dysregulated candidate genes in these tumors is to employ meta-analysis of multiple independent microarray datasets. This allows one to compare expression data from a diverse collection of breast tumor array datasets generated on either {cDNA} or oligonucleotide arrays.

Previous research has demonstrated that this technology can be useful in the classification of cancers. Cancer microarray data normally contains a small number of samples which have a large number of gene expression levels as features. To select relevant genes involved in different types of cancer remains a challenge. In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, nave Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets. We also demonstrate that a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to select relevant genes with high confidence. This is also the first paper which discusses both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of zyxin in leukaemogenesis.},

Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell's identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours from 42 different individuals, using complementary {DNA} microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identified for which variation in messenger {RNA} levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene-expression-profiling studies of primary breast tumors performed by different laboratories have resulted in the identification of a number of distinct prognostic profiles, or gene sets, with little overlap in terms of gene identity.
{METHODS}: To compare the predictions derived from these gene sets for individual samples, we obtained a single data set of 295 samples and applied five gene-expression-based models: intrinsic subtypes, 70-gene profile, wound response, recurrence score, and the two-gene ratio (for patients who had been treated with tamoxifen).
{RESULTS}: We found that most models had high rates of concordance in their outcome predictions for the individual samples. In particular, almost all tumors identified as having an intrinsic subtype of basal-like, {HER}2-positive and estrogen-receptor-negative, or luminal B (associated with a poor prognosis) were also classified as having a poor 70-gene profile, activated wound response, and high recurrence score. The 70-gene and recurrence-score models, which are beginning to be used in the clinical setting, showed 77 to 81 percent agreement in outcome classification.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Even though different gene sets were used for prognostication in patients with breast cancer, four of the five tested showed significant agreement in the outcome predictions for individual patients and are probably tracking a common set of biologic phenotypes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Validation of a novel gene expression signature in independent data sets is a critical step in the development of a clinically useful test for cancer patient risk-stratification. However, validation is often unconvincing because the size of the test set is typically small. To overcome this problem we used publicly available breast cancer gene expression data sets and a novel approach to data fusion, in order to validate a new breast tumor intrinsic list.
{RESULTS}: A 105-tumor training set containing 26 sample pairs was used to derive a new breast tumor intrinsic gene list. This intrinsic list contained 1300 genes and a proliferation signature that was not present in previous breast intrinsic gene sets. We tested this list as a survival predictor on a data set of 311 tumors compiled from three independent microarray studies that were fused into a single data set using Distance Weighted Discrimination. When the new intrinsic gene set was used to hierarchically cluster this combined test set, tumors were grouped into {LumA}, {LumB}, Basal-like, {HER}2+/{ER}-, and Normal Breast-like tumor subtypes that we demonstrated in previous datasets. These subtypes were associated with significant differences in Relapse-Free and Overall Survival. Multivariate Cox analysis of the combined test set showed that the intrinsic subtype classifications added significant prognostic information that was independent of standard clinical predictors. From the combined test set, we developed an objective and unchanging classifier based upon five intrinsic subtype mean expression profiles (i.e. centroids), which is designed for single sample predictions ({SSP}). The {SSP} approach was applied to two additional independent data sets and consistently predicted survival in both systemically treated and untreated patient groups.
{CONCLUSION}: This study validates the "breast tumor intrinsic" subtype classification as an objective means of tumor classification that should be translated into a clinical assay for further retrospective and prospective validation. In addition, our method of combining existing data sets can be used to robustly validate the potential clinical value of any new gene expression profile.},

The basal-like group of tumors is characterized by an expression signature similar to that of the basal/myoepithelial cells of the breast and is reported to have transcriptomic characteristics similar to those of tumors arising in {BRCA}1 germline mutation carriers. They are associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, and typically do not express hormone receptors or {HER}-2 ("triple-negative" phenotype). Therefore, patients with basal-like cancers are unlikely to benefit from currently available targeted systemic therapy. Although basal-like tumors are characterized by distinctive morphologic, genetic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features, neither an accepted consensus on routine clinical identification and definition of this aggressive subtype of breast cancer nor a way of systematically classifying this complex group of tumors has been described. Different definitions are, therefore, likely to produce variable and contradictory results that may hamper consistent identification and development of treatment strategies for these tumors.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} To improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression-based "intrinsic" subtypes luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2-enriched, and basal-like. {METHODS} A 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response ({pCR}) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen.
{RESULTS}: The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for {pCR} of 97\%. {CONCLUSION} Diagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the continuous risk score will be of value for the management of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk score can also be used to assess the likelihood of efficacy from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

The promise of microarrays was of apocalyptic dimensions, with some experts envisaging that it would be a matter of a few years for this technology to replace traditional clinicopathological markers in clinical practice and treatment decision-making. The replacement of histopathology by high-tech and more objective approaches to cancer diagnosis, prognostication and prediction was, at that time, a foregone conclusion. Ten years after the initial publications of translational research studies using microarrays, one cannot deny that this technology has changed the way breast cancer is perceived. It has brought the concept of breast cancer heterogeneity to the forefront of cancer research, and the fact that distinct subtypes of breast cancer are completely different diseases that affect the same anatomical site. Furthermore, it has led to the development of prognostic and predictive 'gene signatures', which are yet to be fully incorporated into clinical practice. Importantly, though, the prognostic and predictive power of microarrays has been shown to be complementary to, rather than a replacement for, traditional clinicopathological parameters. Here we endeavour to provide a fair and balanced assessment of what microarray-based gene expression analysis has taught us in the last decade and its contribution to breast cancer classification, prognostication and prediction.},

Results from these tests led to novel risk stratification methods and to new molecular classification of breast cancer. Some of these tools already complement existing diagnostic tests and can aid medical decision making in some situations. Better understanding of the molecular classes of breast cancer, independent of their prognostic and predictive values, may also lead to new biological insights and eventually to better therapies that are directed toward particular molecular subsets. However, there is substantially less experience with these emerging technologies than with the more established methods, the accuracy of which is often overestimated. This review discusses some of the limitations and strengths of current gene expression-based molecular classification of breast cancer. To provide context for this discussion, we also briefly examine the performance of estrogen receptor immunohistochemistry, which represents an essential part of the routine diagnostic workup for all breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {The identification of genetic events that are involved in the development of human cancer has been facilitated through the development and application of a diverse series of high resolution, high throughput microarray platforms. Essentially there are two types of array; those that carry {PCR} products from cloned nucleic acids (e.g. {cDNA}, {BACs}, cosmids) and those that use oligonucleotides. Each has advantages and disadvantages but it is now possible to survey genome wide {DNA} copy number abnormalities and expression levels to allow correlations between losses, gains and amplifications in tumor cells with genes that are over- and under-expressed in the same samples. The gene expression arrays that provide estimates of {mRNA} levels in tumors have given rise to exon-specific arrays that can identify both gene expression levels, alternative splicing events and {mRNA} processing alterations. Oligonucleotide arrays are also being used to interrogate single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) throughout the genome for linkage and association studies and these have been adapted to quantify copy number abnormalities and loss of heterozygosity events. To identify as yet unknown transcripts tiling arrays across the genome have been developed which can also identify {DNA} methylation changes and be used to identify {DNA}-protein interactions using {ChIP} on Chip protocols. Ultimately {DNA} sequencing arrays will allow resequencing of chromosome regions and whole genomes. With all of these capabilities becoming routine in genomics laboratories, the idea of a systematic characterization of the sum genetic events that give rise to a cancer cell is rapidly becoming a reality.},

Some of these changes, including the mutations of various growth regulatory genes as well as alterations in the transcription of a large number of genes, may lead to resistance to treatment. Therefore, capturing such genomic information of the tumors would enable a physician to decide on the course of treatment options clinically available. Currently, it is still not feasible to identify all the genetic mutations that have occurred in a patient's cancer genome. However, the advent of {DNA} microarray coupled with the completion of the human genome sequence and the identification of all its genes, have made possible genome-wide gene expression profiling of the cancer genome. In this review, we will focus on the application of expression genomics for identifying signature gene expression profiles in primary cancers to predict response to either radio- or chemotherapy. We envision that transcription profiling of the cancer genomes ultimately will not only reveal how altered gene expression results in resistance to treatment, but also be exploited for predicting and personalizing cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {Genomic studies provide scientists with methods to quickly analyse genes and their products en masse. The first high-throughput techniques to be developed were sequencing methods. A great number of genomes from different organisms have thus been sequenced. Genomics is now shifting to the study of gene expression and function. In the past 5-10 years genomics, proteomics and high-throughput microarray technologies have fundamentally changed our ability to study the molecular basis of cells and tissues in health and diseases, giving a new comprehensive view. For example, in cancer research we have seen new diagnostic opportunities for tumour classification, and prognostication. A new exciting development is metabolomics and lab-on-a-chip techniques (which combine miniaturization and automation) for metabolic studies. However, to interpret the large amount of data, extensive computational development is required. In the coming years, we will see the study of biological networks dominating the scene in Physiology. The great accumulation of genomics information will be used in computer programs to simulate biologic processes. Originally developed for genome analysis, bioinformatics now encompasses a wide range of fields in biology from gene studies to integrated biology (i.e. combination of different data sets from genes to metabolites). This is systems biology which aims to study biological organisms as a whole. In medicine, scientific results and applied biotechnologies arising from genomics will be used for effective prediction of diseases and risk associated with drugs. Preventive medicine and medical therapy will be personalized. Widespread applications of genomics for personalized medicine will require associations of gene expression pattern with diagnoses, treatment and clinical data. This will help in the discovery and development of drugs. In agriculture and animal science, the outcomes of genomics will include improvement in food safety, in crop yield, in traceability and in quality of animal products (dairy products and meat) through increased efficiency in breeding and better knowledge of animal physiology. Genomics and integrated biology are huge tasks and no single lab can pursue this alone. We are probably at the end of the beginning rather than at the beginning of the end because Genomics will probably change Biology to a greater extent than previously forecasted. In addition, there is a great need for more information and better understanding of genomics before complete public acceptance.},

To explore the molecular differences between human primary tumors and metastases, we compared the gene-expression profiles of adenocarcinoma metastases of multiple tumor types to unmatched primary adenocarcinomas. We found a gene-expression signature that distinguished primary from metastatic adenocarcinomas. More notably, we found that a subset of primary tumors resembled metastatic tumors with respect to this gene-expression signature. We confirmed this finding by applying the expression signature to data on 279 primary solid tumors of diverse types. We found that solid tumors carrying the gene-expression signature were most likely to be associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome (P {\textless} 0.03). These results suggest that the metastatic potential of human tumors is encoded in the bulk of a primary tumor, thus challenging the notion that metastases arise from rare cells within a primary tumor that have the ability to metastasize.},

To provide a critical overview of gene expression profiling methodology and discuss areas of future development.
Results
Gene expression profiling has been used extensively in biological research and has resulted in significant advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of complex disorders, including cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders. However, translating this technology into genomic medicine for use in diagnosis and prognosis faces many challenges. In addition, gene expression profile analysis is frequently controversial, because its conclusions often lack reproducibility and claims of effective dissemination into translational medicine have, in some cases, been remarkably unjustified. In the last decade, a large number of methodological and technical solutions have been offered to overcome the challenges.
Study Design and Setting
We consider the strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications of gene expression profiling techniques, with particular reference to the clinical relevance.
Conclusion
Some studies have demonstrated the ability and clinical utility of gene expression profiling for use as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive molecular markers. The challenges of gene expression profiling lie with the standardization of analytic approaches and the evaluation of the clinical merit in broader heterogeneous populations by prospective clinical trials.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Both the validity and the reproducibility of microarray-based clinical research have been challenged. There is a need for critical review of the statistical analysis and reporting in published microarray studies that focus on cancer-related clinical outcomes.
{METHODS}: Studies published through 2004 in which microarray-based gene expression profiles were analyzed for their relation to a clinical cancer outcome were identified through a Medline search followed by hand screening of abstracts and full text articles. Studies that were eligible for our analysis addressed one or more outcomes that were either an event occurring during follow-up, such as death or relapse, or a therapeutic response. We recorded descriptive characteristics for all the selected studies. A critical review of outcome-related statistical analyses was undertaken for the articles published in 2004.
{RESULTS}: Ninety studies were identified, and their descriptive characteristics are presented. Sixty-eight (76\%) were published in journals of impact factor greater than 6. A detailed account of the 42 studies (47\%) published in 2004 is reported. Twenty-one (50\%) of them contained at least one of the following three basic flaws: 1) in outcome-related gene finding, an unstated, unclear, or inadequate control for multiple testing; 2) in class discovery, a spurious claim of correlation between clusters and clinical outcome, made after clustering samples using a selection of outcome-related differentially expressed genes; or 3) in supervised prediction, a biased estimation of the prediction accuracy through an incorrect cross-validation procedure.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The most common and serious mistakes and misunderstandings recorded in published studies are described and illustrated. Based on this analysis, a proposal of guidelines for statistical analysis and reporting for clinical microarray studies, presented as a checklist of "Do's and Don'ts," is provided.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: To highlight the development in microarray data analysis for the identification of differentially expressed genes, particularly via control of false discovery rate.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: The emergence of high-throughput technology such as microarrays raises two fundamental statistical issues: multiplicity and sensitivity. We focus on the biological problem of identifying differentially expressed genes. First, multiplicity arises due to testing tens of thousands of hypotheses, rendering the standard P value meaningless. Second, known optimal single-test procedures such as the t-test perform poorly in the context of highly multiple tests. The standard approach of dealing with multiplicity is too conservative in the microarray context. The false discovery rate concept is fast becoming the key statistical assessment tool replacing the P value. We review the false discovery rate approach and argue that it is more sensible for microarray data. We also discuss some methods to take into account additional information from the microarrays to improve the false discovery rate.
{SUMMARY}: There is growing consensus on how to analyse microarray data using the false discovery rate framework in place of the classical P value. Further research is needed on the preprocessing of the raw data, such as the normalization step and filtering, and on finding the most sensitive test procedure.},

Biological, experimental, and technical variations between studies of the same phenotype/phenomena create substantial differences in results. The application of conventional meta-analysis to raw microarray data is complicated by differences in the type of microarray used, gene nomenclatures, species, and analytical methods. An alternative approach to combining multiple microarray studies is to compare the published gene lists which result from the investigators’ analyses of the raw data, as implemented in Lists of Lists Annotated ({LOLA}: www.lola.gwu.edu) and L2L (depts.washington.edu/l2l/). The present review considers both the potential value and the limitations of databasing and enabling the comparison of results from different microarray studies. Further, a major impediment to cross-study comparisons is the absence of a standard for reporting microarray study results. We propose a reporting standard: standard microarray results template ({SMART}), which will facilitate the integration of microarray studies.},

Among several methods available, a few refined approaches have evolved for the analysis of microarray data for cancer diagnosis. These include class comparison, class prediction and class discovery. Using as examples some of the major experimental contributions recently provided in the field of both hematological and solid tumors, we discuss the steps required to utilize microarray data to obtain general and reliable gene profiles that could be universally used in clinical laboratories. As we show, microarray technology is not only a new tool for the clinical lab but it can also improve the accuracy of the classical diagnostic techniques by suggesting novel tumor-specific markers. We then highlight the importance of publicly available microarray data and the development of their integrated analysis that may fulfill the promise that this new technology holds for cancer diagnosis and classification.},

Recent advances in microarray technology have demonstrated reproducibility, making clinical applications more achievable. In this regard, one such {DNA} microarray device based upon a 70-gene expression signature was recently cleared by the {US} {FDA} for application to breast cancer prognosis. These {DNA} microarrays often employ at least 70 gene targets for transcriptional profiling and prognostic assessment in breast cancer. The use of {PCR}-based methods utilizing a small subset of genes has recently demonstrated the ability to predict the clinical outcome in early-stage breast cancer. Furthermore, protein-based immunohistochemistry methods have progressed from using gene clusters and gene expression profiling to smaller subsets of expressed proteins to predict prognosis in early-stage breast cancer. Beyond prognostic applications, {DNA} microarray-based transcriptional profiling has demonstrated the ability to predict response to chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer patients. In this review, recent advances in the use of multiple markers for prognosis of disease recurrence in early-stage breast cancer and the prediction of therapy response will be discussed.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The reliability of microarray-based cancer prognosis is questioned by Michiels et al. They reanalyzed seven studies published in the prominent journals as successful stories of microarray-based cancer prognosis and concluded that the originally reported assessments are over optimistic. We set to investigate the reality of microarrays for predicting cancer prognosis by using the same data sets with commonly accepted data analysis approaches.
{EXPERIMENT} {DESIGN}: Michiels et al.'s analysis protocol used a correlation-based feature selection method, split sample validation, and a nearest-centroid rule classifier. We examined their results through systematically replacing their analysis approaches with other commonly used methods as a parameter study. In addition, we applied a widely accepted permutation test in conjunction with 5-fold cross-validation to verify Michiels et al.'s findings.
{RESULTS}: The stability of signature genes is likely obtained when a fold change-based feature selection method is applied. When cross-validation procedures are used to replace Michiels et al.'s split sample validation, only one of the seven studies yielded uninformative classifiers. The permutation test reveals that the confidence interval based on the split sample used in the Michiels et al.'s review is not a rigorous and robust approach to assess the validity of a classifier.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We concluded that the use of {DNA} microarrays for cancer prognosis can be demonstrated. We also stressed that caution should be exercised when a general conclusion is withdrawn based on a single statistical practice without alternative validation, which can leave a false impression and pessimistic perspective for emerging biomarker methodologies to advance cancer research.},

The algorithms applied for image and data analysis are also as varied as the microarray platforms, perhaps more so. In addition, there is a total lack of universally accepted standards for use among the different platforms and even within the same array types. Due to this lack of coherency in array technologies, confusion in interpretation of data within and across platforms has often been the norm, and studies of the same biological phenomena have, in many cases, led to contradictory results.

Amplification efficiencies clearly allow profiling of extremely small samples. The conservation of transcript abundance is the most important issue regarding the use of sample amplification in combination with microarray analysis, and this aspect has generally been found to be acceptable, although demonstrated to decrease in highly diluted samples. The fact that variability and discrepancies in microarray profiles increase with minute sample sizes has been clearly documented, but for many studies this does appear to have affected the biological conclusions. We suggest that this is due to the data analysis approach applied, and the consequence is the chance of presenting misleading results. We discuss the issue of amplification sensitivity limits in the light of reports on fidelity, published data from reviewed articles and data analysis approaches. These are important considerations to be reflected in the design of future studies and when evaluating biological conclusions from published microarray studies based on extremely low input {RNA} quantities.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The acceptance of microarray technology in regulatory decision-making is being challenged by the existence of various platforms and data analysis methods. A recent report (E. Marshall, Science, 306, 630-631, 2004), by extensively citing the study of Tan et al. (Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 5676-5684, 2003), portrays a disturbingly negative picture of the cross-platform comparability, and, hence, the reliability of microarray technology.
{RESULTS}: We reanalyzed Tan's dataset and found that the intra-platform consistency was low, indicating a problem in experimental procedures from which the dataset was generated. Furthermore, by using three gene selection methods (i.e., p-value ranking, fold-change ranking, and Significance Analysis of Microarrays ({SAM})) on the same dataset we found that p-value ranking (the method emphasized by Tan et al.) results in much lower cross-platform concordance compared to fold-change ranking or {SAM}. Therefore, the low cross-platform concordance reported in Tan's study appears to be mainly due to a combination of low intra-platform consistency and a poor choice of data analysis procedures, instead of inherent technical differences among different platforms, as suggested by Tan et al. and Marshall.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results illustrate the importance of establishing calibrated {RNA} samples and reference datasets to objectively assess the performance of different microarray platforms and the proficiency of individual laboratories as well as the merits of various data analysis procedures.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0001854},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Housekeeping genes are needed in every tissue as their expression is required for survival, integrity or duplication of every cell. Housekeeping genes commonly have been used as reference genes to normalize gene expression data, the underlying assumption being that they are expressed in every cell type at approximately the same level. Often, the terms "reference genes" and "housekeeping genes" are used interchangeably. In this paper, we would like to distinguish between these terms. Consensus is growing that housekeeping genes which have traditionally been used to normalize gene expression data are not good reference genes. Recently, ribosomal protein genes have been suggested as reference genes based on a meta-analysis of publicly available microarray data.
{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: We have applied several statistical tools on a dataset of 70 microarrays representing 22 different tissues, to assess and visualize expression stability of ribosomal protein genes. We confirmed the housekeeping status of these genes, but further estimated expression stability across tissues in order to assess their potential as reference genes. One- and two-way {ANOVA} revealed that all ribosomal protein genes have significant expression variation across tissues and exhibit tissue-dependent expression behavior as a group. Via multidimensional unfolding analysis, we visualized this tissue-dependency. In addition, we explored mechanisms that may cause tissue dependent effects of individual ribosomal protein genes.
{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: Here we provide statistical and biological evidence that ribosomal protein genes exhibit important tissue-dependent variation in {mRNA} expression. Though these genes are most stably expressed of all investigated genes in a meta-analysis they cannot be considered true reference genes.},

	abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: General studies of microarray gene-expression profiling have been undertaken to predict cancer outcome. Knowledge of this gene-expression profile or molecular signature should improve treatment of patients by allowing treatment to be tailored to the severity of the disease. We reanalysed data from the seven largest published studies that have attempted to predict prognosis of cancer patients on the basis of {DNA} microarray analysis.
{METHODS}: The standard strategy is to identify a molecular signature (ie, the subset of genes most differentially expressed in patients with different outcomes) in a training set of patients and to estimate the proportion of misclassifications with this signature on an independent validation set of patients. We expanded this strategy (based on unique training and validation sets) by using multiple random sets, to study the stability of the molecular signature and the proportion of misclassifications.
{FINDINGS}: The list of genes identified as predictors of prognosis was highly unstable; molecular signatures strongly depended on the selection of patients in the training sets. For all but one study, the proportion misclassified decreased as the number of patients in the training set increased. Because of inadequate validation, our chosen studies published overoptimistic results compared with those from our own analyses. Five of the seven studies did not classify patients better than chance.
{INTERPRETATION}: The prognostic value of published microarray results in cancer studies should be considered with caution. We advocate the use of validation by repeated random sampling.},

We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002240},
	abstract = {Bridging the gap between animal or in vitro models and human disease is essential in medical research. Researchers often suggest that a biological mechanism is relevant to human cancer from the statistical association of a gene expression marker (a signature) of this mechanism, that was discovered in an experimental system, with disease outcome in humans. We examined this argument for breast cancer. Surprisingly, we found that gene expression signatures-unrelated to cancer-of the effect of postprandial laughter, of mice social defeat and of skin fibroblast localization were all significantly associated with breast cancer outcome. We next compared 47 published breast cancer outcome signatures to signatures made of random genes. Twenty-eight of them (60\%) were not significantly better outcome predictors than random signatures of identical size and 11 (23\%) were worst predictors than the median random signature. More than 90\% of random signatures {\textgreater}100 genes were significant outcome predictors. We next derived a metagene, called meta-{PCNA}, by selecting the 1\% genes most positively correlated with proliferation marker {PCNA} in a compendium of normal tissues expression. Adjusting breast cancer expression data for meta-{PCNA} abrogated almost entirely the outcome association of published and random signatures. We also found that, in the absence of adjustment, the hazard ratio of outcome association of a signature strongly correlated with meta-{PCNA} (R(2) = 0.9). This relation also applied to single-gene expression markers. Moreover, {\textgreater}50\% of the breast cancer transcriptome was correlated with meta-{PCNA}. A corollary was that purging cell cycle genes out of a signature failed to rule out the confounding effect of proliferation. Hence, it is questionable to suggest that a mechanism is relevant to human breast cancer from the finding that a gene expression marker for this mechanism predicts human breast cancer outcome, because most markers do. The methods we present help to overcome this problem.},

There has been a significant increase in the number of {US} {FDA}-approved drug labels containing information on molecular biomarkers over the last decade. Almost every pharmaceutical company has been developing molecular biomarker programs, either alone, through partnerships or other ventures. More molecular biomarkers are expected to be identified and validated in drug development, and used to support approval of drug products. This article summarizes the current status of molecular biomarkers used for {FDA}-approved drug products, and discusses the challenges and future perspectives for the identification and qualification of molecular biomarkers. Specific {FDA} programs and research projects related to molecular biomarkers are also discussed for supporting regulatory review in the future.},

	abstract = {Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is involved in the development of several epithelial tumors. Wnt signaling includes two major types of pathways: (i) the canonical or Wnt/β-catenin pathway; and (ii) the non-canonical pathways, which do not involve β-catenin stabilization. Among these pathways, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has received most attention during the past years for its critical role in cancer. A number of publications emphasize the role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in thyroid cancer. This pathway plays a crucial role in development and epithelial renewal, and components such as β-catenin and Axin are often mutated in thyroid cancer. Although it is accepted that altered Wnt signaling is a late event in thyroid cell transformation that affects anaplastic thyroid tumors, recent data suggest that it is also altered in papillary thyroid carcinoma ({PTC}) with {RET}/{PTC} mutations. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the main relevant data of Wnt signaling in thyroid cancer, with special emphasis on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.},

	abstract = {Thyroid cancer is a common type of endocrine malignancy, and its incidence has been steadily increasing in many regions of the world. Initiation and progression of thyroid cancer involves multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, of which mutations leading to the activation of the {MAPK} and {PI}3K-{AKT} signaling pathways are crucial. Common mutations found in thyroid cancer are point mutation of the {BRAF} and {RAS} genes as well as {RET}/{PTC} and {PAX}8/{PPARγ} chromosomal rearrangements. The mutational mechanisms seem to be linked to specific etiologic factors. Chromosomal rearrangements have a strong association with exposure to ionizing radiation and possibly with {DNA} fragility, whereas point mutations probably arise as a result of chemical mutagenesis. A potential role of dietary iodine excess in the generation of {BRAF} point mutations has also been proposed. Somatic mutations and other molecular alterations have been recognized as helpful diagnostic and prognostic markers for thyroid cancer and are beginning to be introduced into clinical practice, to offer a valuable tool for the management of patients with thyroid nodules.},

	abstract = {Differentiation is central to development, while dedifferentiation is central to cancer progression. Hence, a quantitative assessment of differentiation would be most useful. We propose an unbiased method to derive organ-specific differentiation indices from gene expression data and demonstrate its usefulness in thyroid cancer diagnosis. We derived a list of thyroid-specific genes by selecting automatically those genes that are expressed at higher level in the thyroid than in any other organ in a normal tissue's genome-wide gene expression compendium. The thyroid index of a tissue was defined as the median expression of these thyroid-specific genes in that tissue. As expected, the thyroid index was inversely correlated with meta-{PCNA}, a proliferation metagene, across a wide range of thyroid tumors. By contrast, the two indices were positively correlated in a time course of thyroid-stimulating hormone ({TSH}) activation of primary thyrocytes. Thus, the thyroid index captures biological information not integrated by proliferation rates. The differential diagnostic of follicular thyroid adenomas and follicular thyroid carcinoma is a notorious challenge for pathologists. The thyroid index discriminated them as accurately as did machine-learning classifiers trained on the genome-wide cancer data. Hence, although it was established exclusively from normal tissue data, the thyroid index integrates the relevant diagnostic information contained in tumoral transcriptomes. Similar results were obtained for the classification of the follicular vs classical variants of papillary thyroid cancers, that is, tumors dedifferentiating along a different route. The automated procedures demonstrated in the thyroid are applicable to other organs.},

Eighty-five studies involving 32,825 patients were analysed. Ki-67 (43 studies, 15,790 patients), {MI} (20 studies, 7021 patients), and {LI} (11 studies, 7337 patients) were associated with significantly shorter overall and disease free survival, using results from univariate and multivariate analyses from the individual studies. {PCNA} (11 studies, 2677 patients) was associated with shorter overall survival by multivariate analysis only, because of lack of data. There was some evidence for publication bias, but all markers remained significant after allowing for this. Ki-67, {MI}, {PCNA} and {LI} are associated with worse survival outcomes in early breast cancer. However, whether these proliferation markers provide additional prognostic information to commonly used prognostic indices remains unclear.},

	volume = {25},
	issn = {1527-7755},
	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2006.07.1522},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: A number of microarray studies have reported distinct molecular profiles of breast cancers ({BC}), such as basal-like, {ErbB}2-like, and two to three luminal-like subtypes. These were associated with different clinical outcomes. However, although the basal and the {ErbB}2 subtypes are repeatedly recognized, identification of estrogen receptor ({ER}) -positive subtypes has been inconsistent. Therefore, refinement of their molecular definition is needed.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We have previously reported a gene expression grade index ({GGI}), which defines histologic grade based on gene expression profiles. Using this algorithm, we assigned {ER}-positive {BC} to either high-or low-genomic grade subgroups and compared these with previously reported {ER}-positive molecular classifications. As further validation, we classified 666 {ER}-positive samples into subtypes and assessed their clinical outcome.
{RESULTS}: Two {ER}-positive molecular subgroups (high and low genomic grade) could be defined using the {GGI}. Despite tracking a single biologic pathway, these were highly comparable to the previously described luminal A and B classification and significantly correlated to the risk groups produced using the 21-gene recurrence score. The two subtypes were associated with statistically distinct clinical outcome in both systemically untreated and tamoxifen-treated populations.
{CONCLUSION}: The use of genomic grade can identify two clinically distinct {ER}-positive molecular subtypes in a simple and highly reproducible manner across multiple data sets. This study emphasizes the important role of proliferation-related genes in predicting prognosis in {ER}-positive {BC}.},
